### Introduction:
The Graham-Buffett Course sequence is important to this college because it enables us to attract students who want this perspective on investing and managing corporations—a perspective that has been successfully employed by Mr. Buffett, Mr. Hawkins and before them, Benjamin Graham.

格雷厄姆-巴菲特课程序列对这所学院很重要，因为它让我们能够吸引那些希望学习这种投资和管理公司视角的学生——这种视角已被巴菲特先生、霍金斯先生以及之前的本杰明·格雷厄姆成功运用。

This perspective is quite simple but is sometimes lost in the complexity of our University analysis. The perspective is that you have to understand the underlying economics of the businesses that you invest in, work in. You have to be clear-eyed and not be swayed by the crowd or passing fancies of the moment.And you have to learn and stick to disciplined principles of business valuation.

这个视角很简单，但在我们大学的复杂分析中有时会被忽略。核心是你必须理解你投资或工作的企业的基本经济原理。你必须保持清醒，不被人群或一时的风潮所动摇。你还必须学习并坚持纪律严明的商业估值原则。

In the long run this disciplined approach will more often than not bring success or more importantly avoid spectacular failures.
 
Hopefully at the University of Florida we can successfully convey those principles and create a program for the very best students and in time the very best employers as well.
 
We thank Mr. Hawkins for his gift (\$1 million) and share his thoughts today.

从长远来看，这种纪律严明的方法往往会带来成功，或者更重要的是，避免惊人的失败。

希望在佛罗里达大学，我们能成功传递这些原则，为最优秀的学生打造一个项目，并最终吸引最优秀的雇主。

我们感谢霍金斯先生的慷慨捐赠（100万美元），并分享他今天的想法。

**Mason Hawkins**: He is someone I have admired tremendously for the last 30 years. In addition, he is someone each of us could pattern our lives after as a role model. It is my honor to introduce our lifetime's best long-term investor……

**梅森·霍金斯**：他是我过去30年非常敬佩的人。此外，他是我们每个人都可以效仿的榜样。很荣幸为我们介绍这位终身最佳长期投资者……

**Buffett**: Testing: One million \$, two million \$….three million \$.

**巴菲特**：测试：一百万美元，两百万美元……三百万美元。

I would like to say a few words primarily and then the highlight for me will be getting your questions. I want to talk about what is on your mind. I urge you to throw hard balls. It's more fun for me if you put a little speed on the pitches as they come in. You can ask about anything except last week's Texas A&M game, that's off limits.

我想先简单说几句话，然后最精彩的部分将是回答你们的问题。我想谈谈你们关心的事情。我鼓励你们抛出难题。如果你们的问题带点力度，我会觉得更有趣。你们可以问任何问题，除了上周的德州农工大学比赛，那是禁区。

##### Your Future

I would like to talk for just one minute to the students about your future when you leave here. Because you will learn a tremendous amount about investments, you'll learn enough to do well; you all have the IQ to do well. You all have the energy and initiative to do well or you wouldn't be here. Most of you will succeed in meeting your aspirations. But in determining whether you succeed there is more to it than intellect and energy. I would like to talk just a second about that. In fact, there was a guy, Pete Kiewit in Omaha, who used to say, he looked for three things in hiring people: integrity, intelligence and energy. And he said if the person did not have the first two, the later two would kill him, because if they don't have integrity, you want them dumb and lazy.

我想对学生们讲一分钟关于你们离开这里后的未来。你们会学到很多关于投资的知识，足以做得很好；你们都有足够的智商，也都有足够的精力和主动性，否则你们不会在这里。你们大多数人都会实现自己的愿望。但决定你们是否成功，不仅仅取决于智力和精力。我想简单谈谈这个。事实上，奥马哈有个人叫皮特·基威特，他常说，招聘时看三件事：正直、智慧和精力。他说，如果一个人没有前两项，后两项会害了他，因为如果他们没有正直，你宁愿他们又蠢又懒。

We want to talk about the first two because we know you have the last two. You are all second-year MBA students, so you have gotten to know your classmates. Think for a moment that I granted you the right--you can buy 10% of one of your classmate’s earnings for the rest of their lifetime. You can't pick someone with a rich father; you have to pick someone who is going to do it on his or her own merit. And I gave you an hour to think about it.

我们想谈谈前两项，因为我们知道你们已经具备后两项。你们都是二年级的MBA学生，已经很了解你们的同学了。想象一下，我给了你一个权利——你可以买下你一位同学未来终生收入的10%。你不能选有富有父亲的人；你得选一个靠自己能力成功的人。我给你一小时思考这个问题。

Will you give them an IQ test and pick the one with the highest IQ? I doubt it. Will you pick the one with the best grades? The most energetic? You will start looking for qualitative factors, in addition to (the quantitative) because everyone has enough brains and energy. You would probably pick the one you responded the best to, the one who has the leadership qualities, the one who is able to get other people to carry out their interests. That would be the person who is generous, honest and who gave credit to other people for their own ideas. All types of qualities. Whomever you admire the most in the class. Then I would throw in a hooker. In addition to this person you had to go short one of your classmates.

你会给他们做智商测试，然后挑那个智商最高的人吗？我不这么认为。你会挑那个成绩最好的？最有精力的？你会开始寻找一些质性因素，作为对量化因素的补充——因为每个人都已经足够聪明、足够有精力了。你很可能会挑选那个你最有共鸣的人，那个有领导才能的人，能够让其他人愿意支持他、帮助他实现目标的人。那将是一个慷慨、诚实的人，也会是一个愿意把功劳归于他人想法的人。各种各样你欣赏的品质。你会挑选班上那个你最钦佩的人。然后，我要增加点趣味。我再给你一个选择 —— 除了买入一个同学的未来外，你还必须做空一个人。

That is more fun. Who do I want to go short? You wouldn't pick the person with the lowest IQ, you would think about the person who turned you off, the person who is egotistical, who is greedy, who cuts corners, who is slightly dishonest.

这样会更有趣一些。那我会想：我想“做空”的人是谁？你不会去挑那个智商最低的人，你会想想那个让你反感的人，那个自负的、贪婪的、投机取巧的、有点不诚实的人。

As you look at those qualities on the left and right hand side, there is one interesting thing about them, it is not the ability to throw a football 60 yards, it is not the ability the run the 100 yard dash in 9.3 seconds, it is not being the best looking person in the class, they are all qualities that if you really want to have the ones on the left hand side, you can have them.

当你仔细看看左边和右边这些品质时，会发现一件有趣的事情：这些品质，并不是你能把橄榄球扔出60码的能力，也不是你能在9.3秒内跑完100码，更不是你是全班最帅或最漂亮的那一个。它们全都不是那些与生俱来的天赋，而是一些——如果你真的想拥有左边那些品质，你是可以拥有的。

They are qualities of behavior, temperament, character that are achievable, they are not forbidden to anybody in this group. And if you look at the qualities on the right hand side the ones that turn you off in other people, there is not a quality there that you have to have. You can get rid of it. You can get rid of it a lot easier at your age than at my age, because most behaviors are habitual. The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken. There is no question about it. I see people with these self-destructive behavior patterns at my age or even twenty years younger and they really are entrapped by them.

这些品质——行为、气质、性格——是可以培养的，这个群体中的任何人都能做到。看看右边那些让你对别人反感的品质，没有一种是你必须具备的。你可以摆脱它们。在你们这个年纪摆脱它们比我这个年纪容易得多，因为大多数行为都是习惯性的。习惯的枷锁在开始时轻得感觉不到，直到它们重得无法打破。这是毫无疑问的。我看到一些人，到了我这个年纪，甚至比我年轻二十岁，他们带着这些自我毁灭的行为模式，真的被它们困住了。

They go around and do things that turn off other people right and left. They don't need to be that way but by a certain point they get so they can hardly change it. But at your age you can have any habits, any patterns of behavior that you wish. It is simply a question of which you decide.

他们四处做事，左左右右地惹人厌。他们本不需要这样，但到了一定时候，他们几乎无法改变。而在你们这个年纪，你们可以拥有任何你想要的习惯、任何行为模式。这只是一个你决定选择哪种的问题。

If you did this… Ben Graham looked around at the people he admired and Ben Franklin did this before him. Ben Graham did this in his low teens and he looked around at the people he admired and he said, "I want to be admired, so why don't I behave like them?" And he found out that there was nothing impossible about behaving like them. Similarly he did the same thing on the reverse side in terms of getting rid of those qualities. I would suggest is that if you write those qualities down and think about them a while and make them habitual, you will be the one you want to buy 10% of when you are all through. And the beauty of it is that you already own 100% of yourself and you are stuck with it. So you might as well be that person, that somebody else.

如果你这样做……本·格雷厄姆观察了他所钦佩的人，本·富兰克林在他之前也这样做过。本·格雷厄姆在十几岁时就这么做了，他观察周围他敬佩的人，然后说：“我想被别人敬佩，那我为什么不表现得像他们一样呢？”他发现，模仿他们的行为并没有什么不可能的。同样地，他也反过来处理，摆脱那些不好的品质。我建议你们把这些品质写下来，仔细思考一段时间，让它们变成习惯，这样当你完成这一切时，你就会成为那个你愿意买下10%股份的人。更妙的是，你已经100%拥有自己，而且你摆脱不掉这个自己。所以，你不如成为那个人，那个别人想成为的人。

Well that is a short little sermon. So let's get on with what you are interested in. Let's start with questions………

这是一个简短的小布道。现在让我们进入你们感兴趣的内容吧。开始提问吧……

**Question 1**: What about Japan? Your thoughts about Japan?

**问题 1**：关于日本？您对日本的看法如何？

**Buffett**: My thoughts about Japan? I am not a macro guy. Now I say to myself Berkshire Hathaway can borrow money in Japan for 10 years at one percent. One percent! I say gee, I took Graham's class 45 years ago and I have been working hard at this all my life maybe I can earn more than 1% annually, it doesn't seem impossible. I wouldn't want to get involved in currency risk, so it would have to be Yen-denominated. I would have to be in Japanese Real Estate or Japanese companies or something of the sort and all I have to do is beat one percent. That is all the money is going to cost me and I can get it for 10 years. So far I haven't found anything. It is kind of interesting. The Japanese businesses earn very low returns on equity - 4% to 5% - 6% on equity and it is very hard to earn a lot as an investor when the business you are in doesn't earn very much money.

**巴菲特**：我对日本的看法？我不是一个宏观分析的人。我对自己说，伯克希尔·哈撒韦可以在日本以1%的利率借到10年的资金。1%！我说，天哪，45年前我上了格雷厄姆的课，一辈子都在努力工作，也许我每年能赚的比1%多，这似乎并不难。我不想承担汇率风险，所以必须是以日元计价的。我得投资日本的房地产或日本公司之类的东西，而我只需要击败1%的回报率就行。这就是资金的成本，而且我能借10年。到目前为止，我还没找到什么机会。这有点意思。日本企业的股本回报率很低——4%到5%，最多6%——当你投资的生意本身赚不了多少钱，作为投资者要赚很多钱是非常难的。

Now some people do it. In fact, I have a friend, Walter Schloss, who worked at Graham at the same time I did. And it was the first way I went at stocks to buy stocks selling way below working capital. A very cheap, quantitative approach to stocks. I call it the cigar butt approach to investing. You walk down the street and you look around for a cigar butt someplace. Finally you see one and it is soggy and kind of repulsive, but there is one puff left in it. So you pick it up and the puff is free--it is a cigar butt stock. You get one free puff on it and then you throw it away and try another one. It is not elegant. But it works. Those are low return businesses.

有些人确实做到了。事实上，我有个朋友沃尔特·施洛斯，和我同时在格雷厄姆手下工作。我最初买股票的方式就是购买远低于营运资本的股票，非常便宜、量化的方法。我称之为“雪茄烟蒂”投资法。就像你走在街上，四处寻找雪茄烟蒂。终于你看到一个，湿乎乎的，有点恶心，但它还有最后一口可以抽。于是你捡起来，抽一口是免费的——这就是雪茄烟蒂股票。你抽一口，然后扔掉，再去找下一个。这不优雅，但它有效。这些是低回报的生意。

**But time is the friend of the wonderful business; it is the enemy of the lousy business**. If you are in a lousy business for a long time, you will get a lousy result even if you buy it cheap. If you are in a wonderful business for a long time, even if you pay a little bit too much going in you will get a wonderful result if you stay in a long time.

**时间是好生意的朋友，却是烂生意的敌人**。如果你在一家烂生意里待得太久，即使买得很便宜，结果也会很糟糕。如果你在一家好生意里长期持有，即使一开始多付了点钱，只要坚持得够久，你也会得到很棒的结果。

I find very few wonderful businesses in Japan at present. They may change the culture in some way so that management gets more share holder responsive over there and stock returns are higher. At the present time you will find a lot of low return businesses and that was true even when the Japanese economy was booming. It is amazing; they had an incredible market without incredible companies. They were incredible in terms of doing a lot of business, but they were not incredible in terms of the return on equity that they achieved and that has finally caught up with them. So we have so far done nothing there. But as long as money is 1% there, we will keep looking.

目前我在日本找到的好生意非常少。或许他们的文化会发生一些变化，让管理层更关注股东利益，股票回报率也会更高。但现在，你会发现很多低回报的生意，即使在日本经济繁荣时期也是如此。令人惊讶的是，他们的市场表现惊人，但公司本身并不出色。它们在业务量上很厉害，但股本回报率并不高，这一点最终还是影响了它们。所以我们在日本至今没有投资。不过，只要那里的资金成本是1%，我们就会继续寻找。

**Question 2**: You were rumored to be one of the rescue buyers of Long Term Capital, what was the play there, what did you see?

**问题 2**：有传言说您是长期资本管理公司（LTCM）的救助买家之一，当时的情况是怎样的？您看到了什么机会？

**Buffett**: The Fortune Magazine that has Rupert Murdoch on the cover. It tells the whole story of our involvement; it is kind of an interesting story. I got the really serious call about LTCM on a Friday afternoon that things were getting serious. I know those people most of them pretty well--most of them at Salomon when I was there. And the place was imploding and the FED was sending people up that weekend. Between that Friday and the following Wed. when the NY Fed, in effect, orchestrated a rescue effort but without any Federal money involved. I was quite active but I was having a terrible time reaching anybody.

**巴菲特**：封面是鲁珀特·默多克的那期《财富》杂志里，详细讲述了我们参与长期资本管理公司（LTCM）的情况，故事还挺有趣的。那是一个周五下午，我接到一个很严肃的电话，说情况变得严重了。我认识LTCM的大多数人——他们在所罗门兄弟公司时我就在那儿，算是很熟了。那地方当时正在崩盘，美联储那个周末派了人过去。从那个周五到接下来的周三，纽约联储实际上组织了一场救助行动，但没有动用任何联邦资金。我那段时间很积极地参与，但联系人特别困难。

We put in a bid on Wednesday morning. I talked to Bill McDonough at the NY Fed. We made a bid for 250 million for the net assets but we would have put in 3 and 3/4 billion on top of that. \$3 billion from Berkshire, \$700 mil. from AIG and \$300 million. from Goldman Sachs. And we submitted that but we put a very short time limit on that because when you are bidding on 100 billion worth of securities that are moving around, you don't want to leave a fixed price bid out there for very long.

我们在周三早上提交了一份报价。我和纽约联储的比尔·麦克多诺谈过。我们为净资产出价2.5亿美元，但在此基础上我们还会再投入37.5亿美元——伯克希尔出30亿美元，AIG出7亿美元，高盛出3亿美元。我们提交了这个报价，但设了一个很短的期限，因为当你对价值1000亿美元且价格波动的证券出价时，你不会想让一个固定价格的报价在市场上停留太久。

In the end the bankers made the deal, but it was an interesting period. The whole LTCM is really fascinating because if you take Larry Hillenbrand, Eric Rosenfeld, John Meriwether and the two Nobel prize winners. If you take the 16 of them, they have about as high an IQ as any 16 people working together in one business in the country, including Microsoft. An incredible amount of intellect in one room. Now you combine that with the fact that those people had extensive experience in the field they were operating in. These were not a bunch of guys who had made their money selling men’s clothing and all of a sudden went into the securities business. They had in aggregate, the 16, had 300 or 400 years of experience doing exactly what they were doing and then you throw in the third factor that most of them had most of their very substantial net worth’s in the businesses. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of their own money up (at risk), super high intellect and working in a field that they knew. Essentially they went broke. That to me is absolutely fascinating.

最后，银行家们达成了交易，但那段时间很有意思。整个长期资本管理公司（LTCM）的事件非常引人入胜，因为如果你看看拉里·希伦布兰德、埃里克·罗森菲尔德、约翰·梅里韦瑟，还有两位诺贝尔奖得主，这16个人聚在一起，他们的智商总和几乎是全国任何一个商业团队里最高的，包括微软。他们的智力惊人。而且，这些人都在他们操作的领域有丰富经验。他们不是一群卖男装赚了钱后突然进入证券行业的人。这16个人加起来有三四百年的经验，专门做他们正在做的事。再加上第三个因素，他们中的大多数人把自己相当可观的净资产都投入了这个生意。数亿的个人资金在里面，高超的智力，熟悉的领域，结果他们基本上破产了。这对我来说绝对是引人入胜的。

If I ever write a book it will be called, Why Smart People Do Dumb Things. My partner says it should be autobiographical. But this might be an interesting illustration. They are perfectly decent guys. I respect them and they helped me out when I had problems at Salomon. They are not bad people at all.

如果我写本书，书名会是《为什么聪明人会做蠢事》。我的搭档说这应该是本自传。但这个例子可能很有趣。他们都是很正派的人。我很尊重他们，在所罗门兄弟公司遇到问题时他们也帮过我。他们完全不是坏人。

But to make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and what they did need. That is just plain foolish; it doesn’t matter what your IQ is. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you it just doesn’t make sense. I don’t care if the odds you succeed are 99 to 1 or 1000 to 1 that you succeed. If you hand me a gun with a million chambers with one bullet in a chamber and put it up to your temple and I am paid to pull the trigger, it doesn’t matter how much I would be paid. I would not pull the trigger. You can name any sum you want, but it doesn’t do anything for me on the upside and I think the downside is fairly clear. Yet people do it financially very much without thinking.

为了赚他们没有也不需要的钱，他们却拿自己拥有的、真正需要的东西去冒险。这纯粹是愚蠢的，不管你的智商有多高。如果你为了对自己不重要的事情，去冒险牺牲对你重要的东西，这完全没有道理。我不在乎你成功的概率是99比1还是1000比1。假如有人递给我一把有一百万个弹膛的枪，里面只有一颗子弹，然后对准你的太阳穴，让我扣动扳机，无论给我多少钱，我都不会扣。因为无论报酬有多高，对我来说好处是零，而坏处显而易见。然而，很多人却在财务上不假思索地这样做。

There was a lousy book with a great title written by Walter Gutman—You Only Have to Get Rich Once. Now that seems pretty fundamental. If you have \$100 million at the beginning of the year and you will make 10% if you are unleveraged and 20% if you are leveraged 99 times out of a 100, what difference if at the end of the year, you have \$110 million or \$120 million? It makes no difference. If you die at the end of the year, the guy who makes up the story may make a typo, he may have said 110 even though you had a 120. You have gained nothing at all. It makes absolutely no difference. It makes no difference to your family or anybody else.

沃尔特·古特曼写了一本不怎么样的书，但书名很棒——《你只需要富一次》。这听起来很基本。如果你年初有1亿美元，不用杠杆你能赚10%，用杠杆99次中有99次能赚20%，那到年底你有1.1亿美元还是1.2亿美元有什么区别呢？完全没区别。如果你年底去世了，写讣告的人可能会打错字，把1.2亿写成1.1亿，你什么也没得到。这根本没意义。对你的家人或其他人也没任何区别。 

The downside, especially if you are managing other people’s money, is not only losing all your money, but it is disgrace, humiliation and facing friends whose money you have lost. Yet 16 guys with very high IQs entered into that game. I think it is madness. It is produced by an over reliance to some extent on things. Those guys would tell me back at Salomon; a six Sigma event wouldn’t touch us. But they were wrong. History does not tell you of future things happening. They had a great reliance on mathematics. They thought that the Beta of the stock told you something about the risk of the stock. It doesn’t tell you a damn thing about the risk of the stock in my view.

如果你在管理别人的钱，坏处不仅仅是失去所有资金，还有耻辱、羞辱，以及面对那些被你亏掉钱的朋友。然而，这16个智商很高的家伙却玩了这种游戏。我认为这太疯狂了。这在某种程度上是由于他们过于依赖某些东西。他们在所罗门兄弟公司时告诉我，六西格玛事件（极低概率事件）不会影响到我们。但他们错了。历史并不能告诉你未来会发生什么。他们非常依赖数学模型。他们以为股票的贝塔值能告诉你股票风险的信息。在我看来，贝塔值对股票的风险根本说明不了什么。

Sigma’s do not tell you about the risk of going broke in my view and maybe now in their view too. But I don’t like to use them as an example. The same thing in a different way could happen to any of us, where we really have a blind spot about something that is crucial, because we know a whole lot of something else. It is like Henry Kauffman said, “The ones who are going broke in this situation are of two types, the ones who know nothing and the ones who know everything.” It is sad in a way.

在我看来，西格玛（统计概率）并不能告诉你破产的风险，也许现在他们也这么认为了。但我不喜欢拿他们做例子。同样的事情，以不同的方式，也可能发生在我们任何人身上，我们可能对某个关键点有盲点，因为我们知道太多其他东西。就像亨利·考夫曼说的：“在这种情况下破产的人有两种，一种是一无所知的，另一种是自以为全都知道的。”这在某种程度上很可悲。

I urge you. We basically never borrow money. I never borrowed money even when I had \$10,000 basically, what difference did it make. I was having fun as I went along it didn’t matter whether I had \$10,000 or \$100,000 or \$1,000,000 unless I had a medical emergency come along.

我强烈建议你们，我们基本上从不借钱。即使我只有一万美元时，我也从没借过钱，这有什么区别呢？我一路走来都很快乐，不管我有1万美元、10万美元还是100万美元，除非遇到医疗紧急情况，否则这些钱对我来说没差别。

I was going to do the same things when I had a little bit of money as when I had a lot of money. If you think of the difference between me and you, we wear the same clothes basically (SunTrust gives me mine), we eat similar food—we all go to McDonald’s or better yet, Dairy Queen, and we live in a house that is warm in winter and cool in summer. We watch the Nebraska (football) game on big screen TV. You see it the same way I see it. We do everything the same—our lives are not that different. The only thing we do is we travel differently. What can I do that you can’t do?

我有很少钱的时候和有很多钱的时候做的事情是一样的。如果你想想我和你的区别，我们基本上穿一样的衣服（SunTrust给我提供了衣服），我们吃相似的食物——我们都去麦当劳，或者更好的是Dairy Queen，我们住的房子冬天暖和夏天凉爽。我们都在大屏幕电视上看内布拉斯加（橄榄球）比赛，你看的方式和我一样。我们做的事情都差不多——我们的生活没什么不同。唯一不同的是我们旅行的方式不同。我能做而你不能做的事情是什么？

I get to work in a job that I love, but I have always worked at a job that I loved. I loved it just as much when I thought it was a big deal to make \$1,000. I urge you to work in jobs that you love. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don’t like because you think it will look good on your resume. I was with a fellow at Harvard the other day who was taking me over to talk. He was 28 and he was telling me all that he had done in life, which was terrific. And then I said, “What will you do next?” “Well,” he said, “Maybe after I get my MBA I will go to work for a consulting firm because it will look good on my resume.” I said, “Look, you are 28 and you have been doing all these things, you have a resume 10 times than anybody I have ever seen. Isn’t that a little like saving up sex for your old age?

我从事的是我热爱的工作，但我一直都在做我热爱的工作。当我认为赚1000美元是件大事时，我也同样热爱这份工作。我强烈建议你们从事自己热爱的工作。如果你一直做不喜欢的工作，只因为觉得它会让你的简历好看，我觉得你疯了。前几天我在哈佛遇到一个28岁的家伙，他带我去演讲，告诉我他人生中做过的所有了不起的事，确实很棒。然后我问他：“接下来你打算做什么？”他说：“嗯，也许拿了MBA后，我会去一家咨询公司工作，因为这在简历上好看。”我说：“你看，你才28岁，已经做了这么多事，你的简历比我见过的任何人都强10倍。这不有点像把性生活攒到老了再用吗？”

There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. When I first got out of Columbia Business School, I wanted to go to work for Graham immediately for nothing. He thought I was over-priced. But I kept pestering him. I sold securities for three years and I kept writing him and finally I went to work for him for a couple of years. It was a great experience. But I always worked in a job that I loved doing. You really should take a job that if you were independently wealthy that would be the job you would take. You will learn something, you will be excited about, and you will jump out of bed. You can’t miss. You may try something else later on, but you will get way more out of it and I don’t care what the starting salary is.

总有一天，你应该开始做自己想做的事。找一份你热爱的工作。你会早上从床上蹦起来。当我刚从哥伦比亚商学院毕业时，我想立刻为格雷厄姆工作，哪怕不拿薪水。他觉得我“定价过高”。但我一直缠着他。我做了三年证券销售，还不停给他写信，最后终于为他工作了几年。那是一段很棒的经历。但我一直都在做我热爱的工作。你真的应该找一份就算你已经很有钱也会去做的工作。你会学到东西，会感到兴奋，会从床上跳起来。你不会失败。以后你可能会尝试别的事情，但你会从中收获更多，我不在乎起薪是多少。

When you get out of here take a job you love, not a job you think will look good on your resume. You ought to find something you like.

从这里毕业后，找一份你热爱的工作，而不是你觉得会让简历好看的工作。你应该找到自己喜欢的事情。

If you think you will be happier getting 2x instead of 1x, you are probably making a mistake. You will get in trouble if you think making 10x or 20x will make you happier because then you will borrow money when you shouldn’t or cut corners on things. It just doesn’t make sense and you won’t like it when you look back.

如果你觉得赚2倍的钱会比1倍更快乐，你可能犯了个错误。如果你认为赚10倍或20倍会让你更开心，那你会惹上麻烦，因为你可能会在不该借钱的时候借钱，或者在做事上偷工减料。这完全没道理，回头看时你也不会喜欢这样的自己。

**Question 3**: What makes a company something that you like?

**问题 3**：是什么让一家公司成为你喜欢的公司？

**Buffett**: I like businesses that I can understand. Let’s start with that. That narrows it down by 90%. There are all types of things I don’t understand, but fortunately, there is enough I do understand. You have this big wide world out there and almost every company is publicly owned. So you have all American business practically available to you. So it makes sense to go with things you can understand.

**巴菲特**：我喜欢我能理解的生意。先从这点开始。这就把范围缩小了90%。有很多东西我不懂，但幸好我懂的也够多了。外面有这个广阔的世界，几乎每家公司都是公开上市的。所以几乎所有的美国企业你都可以投资。选择你能理解的生意是合情合理的。

I can understand this, anyone can understand this (Buffett holds up a bottle of Coca-Cola). Since 1886, it is a simple business, but it is not an easy business—I don’t want an easy business for competitors. I want a business with a moat around it. I want a very valuable castle in the middle and then I want the Duke who is in charge of that castle to be very honest and hard working and able. Then I want a moat around that castle. The moat can be various things: The moat around our auto insurance business, Geico, is low cost. People have to buy auto insurance so everyone is going to have one auto insurance policy per car basically. I can’t sell them 20, but they have to buy one. I can sell them 1. What are they going to buy it on? (based on what criteria?) They (customers) will buy based on service and cost. Most people will assume the service is identical among companies or close enough. So they will do it on cost. So I have to be a low cost producer--that is my moat. To the extent that my costs are further below the other guy, I have thrown a couple of sharks into the moat. All the time you have this wonderful castle, there are people out there who are going to attack it and try to take it away from you. I want a castle I can understand, but I want a castle with a moat around it.

我能理解这个生意，任何人都能理解这个。（巴菲特举起一瓶可口可乐）从1886年开始，这是个简单的生意，但不是个容易的生意——我不希望竞争对手觉得这生意容易。我想要一个有护城河的生意。我想要一个中间有座非常珍贵的城堡，然后我希望掌管这座城堡的公爵非常诚实、勤奋且能干。我还要这座城堡周围有条护城河。护城河可以是各种东西：我们汽车保险生意Geico的护城河是低成本。人们必须买汽车保险，基本上每辆车都需要一份保险。我不能卖给他们20份，但他们必须买一份。我能卖给他们一份。他们会根据什么来买？（基于什么标准？）他们（客户）会根据服务和成本来选择。大多数人会假设各公司的服务差不多或足够接近。所以他们会看成本。所以我必须是低成本的生产者——这就是我的护城河。如果我的成本比别人低得多，我就相当于在护城河里放了几条鲨鱼。你的这座宝贵城堡无时无刻都有人想攻击它，试图把它夺走。我想要一座我能理解的城堡，但我也想要这座城堡有护城河保护。

##### Kodak

30 years ago, Eastman Kodak’s moat was just as wide as Coca-Cola’s moat. I mean if you were going to take a picture of your six-month old baby and you want to look at that picture 20 years from now or 50 years from now. And you are never going to get a chance—you are not a professional photographer—so you can evaluate what is going to look good 20 or 50 years ago. What is in your mind about that photography company is what counts. Because they are promising you that the picture you take today is going to be terrific 20 to 50 years from now about something that is very important to you. Well, Kodak had that in spades 30 years ago, they owned that. They had what I call share of mind. Forget about share of market, share of mind. They had something—that little yellow box—that said Kodak is the best. That is priceless. They have lost some of that. They haven’t lost it all. 

30年前，柯达的护城河和可口可乐的一样宽广。我的意思是，如果你想给六个月大的宝宝拍张照片，希望20年或50年后还能看到这张照片，而你不是专业摄影师，所以你无法评估20或50年后照片看起来怎么样。你对那家摄影公司的印象才是关键。因为他们在承诺你今天拍的照片在20到50年后依然会很棒，而这对你来说非常重要。30年前，柯达在这方面占据绝对优势，他们拥有这个。他们有我所说的“心智占有率”。别管市场占有率，是心智占有率。他们有那个东西——那个小黄盒子——告诉你柯达是最好的。这是无价的。他们现在失去了一些这种优势，但还没完全失去。

It is not due to George Fisher. George is doing a great job, but they let that moat narrow. They let Fuji come and start narrowing the moat in various ways. They let them get into the Olympics and take away that special aspect that only Kodak was fit to photograph the Olympics. So Fuji gets there and immediately in people’s minds, Fuji becomes more into parity with Kodak.

这不是因为乔治·费希尔。乔治干得很好，但他们让护城河变窄了。他们让富士胶片通过各种方式开始缩小护城河。他们让富士进入了奥运会，拿走了原本只有柯达才适合拍摄奥运会的特殊地位。于是富士一进来，人们的脑海里，富士就和柯达变得更势均力敌了。

You haven’t seen that with Coke; Coke’s moat is wider now than it was 30 years ago. You can’t see the moat day by day but every time the infrastructure that gets built in some country that isn’t yet profitable for Coke that will be 20 years from now. The moat is widening a little bit. Things are, all the time, changing a little in one direction or the other. Ten years from now, you will see the difference. Our managers of the businesses we run, I have one message to them, and we want to widen the moat. We want to throw crocs, sharks and gators—I guess—into the moat to keep away competitors. That comes about through service, through quality of product, it comes about through cost, some times through patents, and/or real estate location. So that is the business I am looking for.

你不会在可口可乐身上看到这种情况；现在可口可乐的护城河比30年前更宽。你不会每天都看到护城河的变化，但每次在某个国家建立的基础设施——现在对可口可乐来说可能还没盈利，但20年后会盈利——护城河就拓宽了一点。事情总是在一点点地朝某个方向变化。十年后，你会看到差别。我们管理公司的经理们，我对他们只有一个要求：我们要拓宽护城河。我们要把鳄鱼、鲨鱼和短吻鳄——我想是这些——扔进护城河，挡住竞争者。这通过服务、产品质量、成本，有时通过专利或房地产位置来实现。这就是我寻找的生意。

Now what kind of businesses am I going to find like that? Well, I am going to find them in simple products because I am not going to be able to figure what the moat is going to look like for Oracle, Lotus or Microsoft, ten years from now. Gates is the best businessman I have ever run into and they have a hell of a position, but I really don’t know what that business is going to look like ten years from now. I certainly don’t know what his competitors will look like ten years from now. I know what the chewing business will look like ten years from now. The Internet is not going to change how we chew gum and nothing much else is going to change how we chew gum. There will lots of new products. Is Spearmint or Juicy Fruit going to evaporate? It isn’t going to happen. You give me a billion dollars and tell me to go into the chewing gum business and try to make a real dent in Wrigley’s. I can’t do it. That is how I think about businesses. I say to myself, give me a billion dollars and how much can I hurt the guy? Give me \$10 billion dollars and how much can I hurt Coca-Cola around the world? I can’t do it. Those are good businesses. 

那么，我会找到什么样的生意呢？我会去找简单产品的生意，因为我无法预测像Oracle、Lotus或微软这样的公司在十年后的护城河会是什么样子。盖茨是我见过的最优秀的生意人，他们的位置非常强大，但我真的不知道他们的生意十年后会是什么样子。我当然也不知道他们的竞争对手十年后会是什么样。但我知道口香糖生意十年后会是什么样子。互联网不会改变我们嚼口香糖的方式，也没有什么会大幅改变我们嚼口香糖的方式。会有很多新产品。绿箭或多汁果味口香糖会消失吗？不会发生。你给我10亿美元，让我进入口香糖生意，试图对箭牌造成实质性打击，我做不到。这就是我对生意的思考方式。我会问自己，给我10亿美元，我能多大程度伤害这个家伙？给我100亿美元，我能在全球范围内多大程度伤害可口可乐？我做不到。这些就是好生意。

Now give me some money and tell me to hurt somebody in some other fields, and I can figure out how to do it.

现在给我一些钱，告诉我去某些其他领域打击别人，我就能想出办法。

So I want a simple business, easy to understand, great economics now, honest and able management, and then I can see about in a general way where they will be ten (10) years from now. If I can’t see where they will be ten years from now, I don’t want to buy it. Basically, I don’t want to buy any stock where if they close the NYSE tomorrow for five years, I won’t be happy owning it. I buy a farm and I don’t get a quote on it for five years and I am happy if the farm does OK. I buy an apartment house and don’t get a quote on it for five years, I am happy if the apartment house produces the returns that I expect. People buy a stock and they look at the price next morning and they decide to see if they are doing well or not doing well. It is crazy. They are buying a piece of the business. That is what Graham—the most fundamental part of what he taught me.

所以我想要一个简单、容易理解的生意，现在有很好的经济效益，管理层诚实且能干，然后我能大致看出它十年后会怎样。如果我看不出十年后它会怎样，我就不想买。基本上，如果明天纽约证券交易所关闭五年，我不会因为持有某个股票而不开心，我就不会买。我买一个农场，五年内没有报价，我也会开心，只要农场表现还行。我买一栋公寓楼，五年内没有报价，我也会开心，只要公寓楼能带来我预期的回报。人们买股票，第二天早上看价格，就决定自己是赚了还是亏了。这太疯狂了。他们买的是一门生意的部分。这是格雷厄姆教我的最基本的原则。

**You are not buying a stock, you are buying part ownership in a business**. You will do well if the business does well, if you didn’t pay a totally silly price. That is what it is all about. You ought to buy businesses you understand. Just like if you buy farms, you ought to buy farms you understand. It is not complicated.

**你买的不是股票，你买的是一家生意的部分所有权**。如果这门生意做得好，你也会做得好，只要你没有付一个完全离谱的价格。这就是核心。你应该买你理解的生意。就像买农场，你应该买你懂得经营的农场。这并不复杂。

Incidentally, by the way, in calling this Graham-Buffett, this is pure Graham. I was very fortunate. I picked up his book (The Intelligent Investor) when I was nineteen; I got interested in stocks when I was 6 or 7. I bought my first stock when I was eleven. But I was playing around with all this stuff—I had charts and volume and I was making all types of technical calculations and everything. Then I picked up a little book that said you are not just buying some little ticker symbol, that bounces around every day, you are buying part of a business. Soon as I started thinking about it that way, everything else followed. It is very simple. So we buy businesses we think we can understand. There is no one here who can’t understand Coke…………..

顺便说一句，提到这个格雷厄姆-巴菲特课程，这完全是格雷厄姆的理念。我很幸运。十九岁时我读了他的书（《聪明的投资者》）；我六七岁时就对股票感兴趣，十一岁时买了第一只股票。但那时候我只是在玩这些东西——我有图表、成交量，做了各种技术分析和计算。然后我读到一本小书，它告诉我，你买的不仅仅是一个每天波动的股票代码，你买的是一家生意的部分。一旦我开始这样思考，一切就都顺理成章了。这很简单。所以我们买那些我们认为能理解的生意。在座的没有谁会不懂可口可乐……
 
If I was teaching a class at business school, on the final exam I would pass out the information on an Internet company and ask each student to value it. Anybody that gave me an answer, I’d flunk (Laughter).
 
如果我在商学院教课，期末考试我会发一份关于一家互联网公司的资料，让每个学生给它估值。任何人给我一个答案，我就让他不及格。（笑声）

I don’t know how to do it. But people do it all the time; it is more exciting. If you look at it like you are going to the races--that is a different thing--but if you are investing…. **Investing is putting out money to be sure of getting more back later at an appropriate rate. And to do that you have to understand what you are doing at any time. You have to understand the business**. You can understand some businesses but not all businesses.

我不知道怎么估值。但人们一直在这样做；这样更刺激。如果你把投资看成是去赛马场——那完全是另一回事——但如果你是在投资……**投资就是把钱投出去，确保以后能以合适的回报率拿回更多钱。要做到这一点，你必须随时明白自己在做什么。你得理解这门生意**。你能理解一些生意，但不是所有的生意。

**Question 4**: You covered half of it which is trying to understand a business and buying a business. You also alluded to getting a return on the amount of capital invested in the business. How do you determine what is the proper price to pay for the business?

**问题 4**：您已经讲了一半，关于理解一门生意和购买一门生意。您还提到了投资在生意中的资本回报。你如何确定为这门生意支付的合适价格？

**Buffett**: It is a tough thing to decide but I don’t want to buy into any business I am not terribly sure of. So if I am terribly sure of it, it probably won’t offer incredible returns. Why should something that is essentially a cinch to do well, offer you 40% a year? We don’t have huge returns in mind, but we do have in mind not losing anything. We bought See’s Candy in 1972, See’s Candy was then selling 16 m. pounds of candy at a \$1.95 a pound and it was making 2 bits a pound or \$4 million pre-tax. We paid \$25 million for it—6.25 x pretax or about 10x after tax. It took no capital to speak of. When we looked at that business—basically, my partner, Charlie, and I—we needed to decide if there was some untapped pricing power there. Where that \$1.95 box of candy could sell for \$2 to \$2.25. If it could sell for \$2.25 or another \$0.30 per pound that was \$4.8 on 16 million pounds. Which on a \$25 million purchase price was fine. We never hired a consultant in our lives; our idea of consulting was to go out and buy a box of candy and eat it.

**巴菲特**: 这是一件很难决定的事，但我不想买我不非常确定的生意。所以，如果我对它非常有把握，它可能不会带来惊人的回报。为什么一个几乎肯定会表现很好的生意，能给你每年40%的回报呢？我们不指望巨大的回报，但我们确实想着不要亏本。我们在1972年买了喜诗糖果，当时喜诗每年卖1600万磅糖果，每磅1.95美元，每磅赚0.25美元的利润，也就是税前400万美元。我们花了2500万美元买下它——税前6.25倍，税后大约10倍。几乎不需要什么资本。我和我的搭档查理在看这门生意时，需要判断那里是否还有未挖掘的定价能力。那盒1.95美元的糖果能不能卖到2美元或2.25美元。如果能卖到2.25美元，也就是每磅多0.3美元，1600万磅就是480万美元的利润。以2500万美元的收购价来说，这就很不错了。我们从没请过顾问；我们所谓的咨询，就是出去买一盒糖果，吃吃看。

What we did know was that they had share of mind in California. There was something special. Every person in Ca. has something in mind about See’s Candy and overwhelmingly it was favorable. They had taken a box on Valentine’s Day to some girl and she had kissed him. If she slapped him, we would have no business. As long as she kisses him, that is what we want in their minds. See’s Candy means getting kissed. If we can get that in the minds of people, we can raise prices. I bought it in 1972, and every year I have raised prices on Dec. 26th, the day after Christmas, because we sell a lot on Christmas. In fact, we will make \$60 million this year. We will make \$2 per pound on 30 million pounds. Same business, same formulas, same everything--\$60 million bucks and it still doesn’t take any capital.

我们知道的是，喜诗糖果在加州有心智占有率。它有种特别的感觉。加州的每个人想到喜诗糖果，绝大多数都是好印象。他们在情人节带一盒糖果给某个女孩，她亲了他们一下。如果她扇了他们一巴掌，我们就没生意了。只要她亲他们，这就是我们想要在人们心中的印象。喜诗糖果就意味着被亲一下。如果我们能让人们有这种印象，我们就能提价。我在1972年买下它后，每年12月26日，也就是圣诞节后一天，我都会提价，因为我们在圣诞节卖很多糖果。事实上，今年我们会赚6000万美元。我们在3000万磅糖果上每磅赚2美元。一样的生意，一样的配方，一切都没变——6000万美元，而且还是几乎不需要什么资本。

And we make more money 10 years from now. But of that \$60 million, we make \$55 million in the three weeks before Christmas. And our company song is: “What a friend we have in Jesus.” (Laughter). It is a good business. Think about it a little. Most people do not buy boxed chocolate to consume themselves, they buy them as gifts— somebody’s birthday or more likely it is a holiday. Valentine’s Day is the single biggest day of the year. Christmas is the biggest season by far. Women buy for Christmas and they plan ahead and buy over a two or three week period. Men buy on Valentine’s Day. They are driving home; we run ads on the Radio. Guilt, guilt, guilt—guys are veering off the highway right and left. They won’t dare go home without a box of Chocolates by the time we get through with them on our radio ads. So that Valentine’s Day is the biggest day.

十年后我们会赚更多钱。但在这6000万美元中，有5500万是在圣诞节前的三周赚的。我们的公司歌曲是：“耶稣是多么好的朋友。”（笑声）这是一门好生意。稍微想想，大多数人买盒装巧克力不是给自己吃的，他们是买来送礼的——某人的生日，或者更常见的是节日。情人节是一年中最大的单日销售，圣诞节则是最大的销售季。女人为圣诞节买巧克力，她们会提前计划，在两三周内购买。男人则在情人节买。他们开车回家，我们在广播里做广告。内疚，内疚，内疚——男人们在高速公路上左冲右突。到我们广播广告结束时，他们不敢不带一盒巧克力回家。所以情人节是最大的单日销售。

Can you imagine going home on Valentine’s Day—our See’s Candy is now \$11 a pound thanks to my brilliance. And let’s say there is candy available at \$6 a pound. Do you really want to walk in on Valentine’s Day and hand—she has all these positive images of See’s Candy over the years—and say, “Honey, this year I took the low bid.” And hand her a box of candy. It just isn’t going to work. So in a sense, there is untapped pricing power—it is not price dependent.

你能想象在情人节回家——我们的喜诗糖果现在每磅11美元，这得归功于我的聪明。假设有每磅6美元的糖果。你真的想在情人节走进去，递给她一盒糖果——她多年来对喜诗糖果有那么多美好印象——然后说：“亲爱的，今年我选了便宜货。”这根本行不通。所以，从某种意义上说，这里有未挖掘的定价能力——它并不依赖价格。

Think of Disney. Disney is selling Home Videos for \$16.95 or \$18.95 or whatever. All over the world—people, and we will speak particularly about Mothers in this case, have something in their mind about Disney. Everyone in this room, when you say Disney, has something in their mind about Disney. When I say Universal Pictures, if I say 20th Century Fox, you don’t have anything special in your mind. Now if I say Disney, you have something special in your mind. That is true around the world.

想想迪士尼。迪士尼的家庭录像带卖16.95美元或18.95美元，诸如此类。在全世界——特别是母亲们，在这里我们特别说说母亲——她们对迪士尼有种特殊的印象。在座的每个人，当我说“迪士尼”时，你脑海里都会浮现一些关于迪士尼的东西。如果我说环球影业或20世纪福克斯，你脑海里不会有特别的印象。但我说迪士尼，你就会有种特别的感觉。这种感觉在全世界都适用。

Now picture yourself with a couple of young kids, whom you want to put away for a couple of hours every day and get some peace of mind. You know if you get one video, they will watch it twenty times. So you go to the video store or wherever to buy the video. Are you going to sit there and premier 10 different videos and watch them each for an hour and a half to decide which one your kid should watch? No. Let’s say there is one there for \$16.95 and the Disney one for \$17.95—you know if you take the Disney video that you are going to be OK. So you buy it. You don’t have to make a quality decision on something you don’t want to spend the time to do. So you can get a little bit more money if you are Disney and you will sell a lot more videos. It makes it a wonderful business. It makes it very tough for the other guy.

现在想象你有几个年幼的孩子，你想让他们每天安静几个小时，好让自己有点清静。你知道如果买一部录像带，他们会看二十遍。你会去音像店或其他地方买录像带。你会花时间预览十部不同的录像带，每部看一个半小时，来决定哪一部适合你的孩子看吗？不会。假设有一部录像带卖16.95美元，迪士尼的卖17.95美元——你知道选迪士尼的肯定没问题。所以你就买了。你不需要在你不想花时间的事情上做质量判断。所以如果你是迪士尼，你就能多赚点钱，而且会卖出更多录像带。这让它成为一门很棒的生意，也让竞争对手很难应对。

How would you try to create a brand—Dreamworks is trying—that competes with Disney around the world and replaces the concept that people have in their minds about Disney with something that says, Universal Pictures? So a mother is going to walk in and pick out a Universal Pictures video in preference to a Disney. It is not going to happen.

你会如何打造一个品牌——比如梦工厂正在尝试的那样——在全球范围内与迪士尼竞争，取代人们心中对迪士尼的印象，换成对环球影业的印象？让一位母亲走进店里，优先选择环球影业的录像带而不是迪士尼的？这是不可能的。

Coca-Cola is associated with people being happy around the world. Everyplace – Disneyland, the World Cup, the Olympics—where people are happy. Happiness and Coke go together. Now you give me—I don’t care how much money—and tell me that I am going to do that with RC Cola around the world and have five billion people have a favorable image in their mind about RC Cola. You can’t get it done. You can fool around, you can do what you want to do. You can have price discounts on weekends. But you are not going to touch it. That is what you want to have in a business. That is the moat. You want that moat to widen.

可口可乐在全世界都与人们的快乐联系在一起。任何地方——迪士尼乐园、世界杯、奥运会——只要是人们感到快乐的地方，都有可口可乐。快乐和可口可乐是连在一起的。现在你给我——不管多少钱——让我用皇家可乐（RC Cola）在全世界做到这一点，让50亿人脑海里对皇家可乐有好印象。你做不到。你可以折腾，随便你怎么做。你可以在周末搞价格折扣。但你动摇不了它。这就是你想要的生意。这就是护城河。你想要这护城河越来越宽。

If you are See’s Candy, you want to do everything in the world to make sure that the experience basically of giving that gift leads to a favorable reaction. It means what is in the box, it means the person who sells it to you, because all of our business is done when we are terribly busy. People come in during theose weeks before Chirstmas, Valentine’s Day and there are long lines. So at five o’clock in the afternoon some woman is selling someone the last box candy and that person has been waiting in line for maybe 20 or 30 customers. And if the salesperson smiles at that last customer, our moat has widened and if she snarls at ‘em, our moat has narrowed. We can’t see it, but it is going on everyday. But it is the key to it. It is the total part of the product delivery. It is having everything associated with it say, See’s Candy and something pleasant happening. That is what business is all about.

如果你是喜诗糖果，你会想尽一切办法确保送礼的体验能带来好的反应。这包括盒子里装的东西，也包括卖糖果给你的那个人，因为我们的生意在特别忙的时候进行。人们在圣诞节前几周、情人节来买糖果，排着长队。下午五点，某个女售货员在卖最后一盒糖果，那位顾客可能已经排队等了20或30个人。如果这个售货员对最后一个顾客微笑，我们的护城河就拓宽了；如果她对顾客发脾气，我们的护城河就变窄了。我们看不见这些，但它每天都在发生。这是关键。这是产品交付的全部。让一切与喜诗糖果相关的体验都令人愉快。这就是生意的本质。

**Question 5**: If I have every bought a company where the numbers told me not to. How much is quantitative and how much is qualitative?

**问题 5**：我有没有买过一家公司，明明数字告诉我不要买？定量分析和定性分析各占多少比重？

**Buffett**: The best buys have been when the numbers almost tell you not to. Because then you feel so strongly about the product. And not just the fact you are getting a used cigar butt cheap. Then it is compelling. I owned a windmill company at one time. Windmills are cigar butts, believe me. I bought it very cheap, I bought it at a third of working capital. And we made money out of it, but there is no repetitive money to be made on it. There is a one-time profit in something like that. And it is just not the thing to be doing. I went through that phase. I bought streetcar companies and all kinds of things. In terms of the qualitative, I probably understand the qualitative the moment I get the phone call. Almost every business we have bought has taken five or ten minutes in terms of analysis. We bought two businesses this year.

**巴菲特**：最好的投资往往是那些数字几乎告诉你不要买的时候。因为那时你对产品有非常强烈的信心，不仅仅是因为你以低价买到了一个用过的“雪茄烟蒂”。那时候它就很有吸引力。我曾经拥有一家风车公司。风车就是“雪茄烟蒂”，相信我。我买得很便宜，只有营运资本的三分之一。我们从中赚了钱，但这种生意没有持续的利润可赚。这样的生意只有一次性的利润，不是应该做的事。我经历过那个阶段。我买过电车公司之类的东西。至于定性分析，我可能在接到电话的那一刻就已经明白了。我们买的几乎每家公司，分析时间只需要五到十分钟。今年我们买了两家公司。

General Re is a \$18 billion deal. I have never been to their home office. I hope it is there. (Laughter) “There could be a few guys there saying what numbers should we send Buffett this month?” I could see them going once a month and saying we have \$20 billion in the bank instead of \$18 billion. I have never been there.

通用再保险是个180亿美元的交易。我从没去过他们的总部。我希望它真的存在。（笑声）“那里可能有几个人在说，这个月我们该给巴菲特报什么数字？”我能想象他们每个月聚一次，说我们有200亿美元在银行，而不是180亿。我从没去过那里。

Before I bought Executive Jet, which is fractional ownership of jets, before I bought it, I had never been there. I bought my family a quarter interest in the program three years earlier. And I have seen the service and it seems to develop well. And I got the numbers. But if you don’t know enough to know about the business instantly, you won’t know enough in a month or in two months. You have to have sort of the background of understanding and knowing what you do or don’t understand. That is the key. It is defining your circle of competence.

在买下Executive Jet之前——那是私人飞机部分所有权的生意——我从没去过那里。三年前我为家人买了这个项目的四分之一份额。我体验过他们的服务，感觉发展得不错。我也拿到了数据。但如果你不能立刻对这门生意有足够的了解，一个月或两个月后你也不会知道更多。你得有理解的基础，知道自己懂什么、不懂什么。这是关键。就是要划定你的能力圈。

**Everybody has got a different circle of competence. The important thing is not how big the circle is, the important thing is the size of the circle; the important thing is staying inside the circle**. And if that circle only has 30 companies in it out of 1000s on the big board, as long as you know which 30 they are, you will be OK. And you should know those businesses well enough so you don’t need to read lots of work. Now I did a lot of work in the earlier years just getting familiar with businesses and the way I would do that is use what Phil Fisher would call, the “Scuttlebutt Approach.” I would go out and talk to customers, suppliers, and maybe ex-employees in some cases. Everybody. Everytime I was interested in an industry, say it was coal, I would go around and see every coal company. I would ask every CEO, “If you could only buy stock in one coal company that was not your own, which one would it be and why? You piece those things together, you learn about the business after awhile.

**每个人的能力圈都不一样。重要的不是能力圈有多大，而是你得清楚能力圈的边界；重要的是待在能力圈内**。如果你的能力圈里只有30家公司，而大盘有几千家公司，只要你知道是哪30家，你就没问题。你应该对这些生意足够了解，不需要读一堆资料。我早年花了很多时间熟悉各种生意，我用的是菲尔·费雪所谓的“八卦法”。我会出去和客户、供应商聊，甚至有时候和前员工聊。所有人我都聊。每当我对一个行业感兴趣，比如煤炭，我就跑遍每家煤炭公司。我会问每个CEO：“如果你只能买一家不是你自己的煤炭公司的股票，你会选哪家，为什么？”你把这些信息拼凑起来，慢慢就会了解这个行业。

Funny, you get very similar answers as long as you ask about competitors. If you had a silver bullet and you could put it through the head of one competitor, which competitor and why? You will find who the best guy is in the industry. So there are a lot of things you can learn about a business. I have done that in the past on the business I felt I could understand so I don’t have to do that anymore. The nice thing about investing is that you don’t have to learn anything new. You can do it if you want to, but if you learn Wrigley’s chewing gum forty years ago, you still understand Wrigley’s chewing gum. There are not a lot of great insights to get of the sort as you go along. So you do get a database in your head.

有趣的是，只要你问关于竞争对手的问题，得到的答案都很相似。如果给你一颗银子弹，你可以干掉一个竞争对手，你会选谁，为什么？你会发现谁是行业里最厉害的家伙。所以，你可以学到很多关于一门生意的知识。我过去对那些我认为能理解的生意做过这种事，所以现在不用再做了。投资的好处是你不需要学新东西。你可以去学新东西，但如果你四十年前了解了箭牌口香糖，你现在还是了解箭牌口香糖。不会有太多新的洞见需要不断获取。所以，你的脑海里会逐渐建立一个数据库。

I had a guy, Frank Rooney, who ran Melville for many years; his father-in-law died and had owned H.H. Brown, a shoe company. And he put it up with Goldman Sachs. But he was playing golf with a friend of mine here in Florida and he mentioned it to this friend, so my friend said “Why don’t you call Warren?” He called me after the match and in five minutes I basically had a deal.

我认识一个叫弗兰克·鲁尼的家伙，他多年来管理Melville公司。他的岳父去世了，岳父拥有一家叫H.H. Brown的鞋业公司。他把公司交给高盛出售。但他和我在佛罗里达的一个朋友打高尔夫时，提到了这件事，我的朋友说：“为什么不给沃伦打个电话？”他在比赛后给我打了电话，五分钟内我们基本上就谈妥了交易。

But I knew Frank, and I knew the business. I sort of knew the basic economics of the shoe business, so I could buy it. Quantitatively, I have to decide what the price is. But, you know, that is either yes or no. I don’t fool a lot around with negotiations. If they name a price that makes sense to me, I buy it. If they don’t, I was happy the day before, so I will be happy the day after without owning it. 

但我认识弗兰克，我也了解这门生意。我大致知道鞋业的基本经济情况，所以我可以买下它。在定量方面，我得决定价格。但你知道，这要么是行，要么是不行。我不会在谈判上浪费太多时间。如果他们开出的价格对我来说合理，我就买。如果不合理，我前一天过得开心，没买的第二天我还是会开心。

**Question 6**: The Asian Crisis and how it affects a company like Coke that recently announced their earnings would be lower in the fourth quarter. 

**问题 6**：亚洲金融危机及其对像可口可乐这样一家公司（最近宣布第四季度盈利将下降）的影响。

**Buffett**: Well, basically I love it, but because the market for Coca-Cola products will grow far faster over the next twenty years internationally than it will in the United States. It will grow in the U.S. on a per capita basis. The fact that it will be a tough period for who knows—three months or three years—but it won’t be tough for twenty years. People will still be going to be working productively around the world and they are going to find this is a bargain product in terms of a portion of their working day that they have to give up in order to have one of these, better yet, five of them a day like I do.

**巴菲特**：基本上，我很看好可口可乐，因为在未来二十年，可口可乐产品的国际市场增长会远超美国。在美国，人均消费量也会增长。可能会有一段艰难时期——谁知道是三个月还是三年——但二十年后不会艰难。全世界的人们仍然会高效地工作，他们会发现这款产品很划算，只需要牺牲工作日的一小部分时间，就能买到一瓶，甚至像我一样一天喝五瓶。

This is a product that in 1936 when I first bought 6 of those for a quarter and sold them for a nickel each. It was in a 6.5 oz bottle and you paid a two cents deposit on the bottle. That was a 6.5 oz. bottle for a nickel at that time; it is now a 12 oz. can which if you buy it on Weekends or if you buy it in bigger quantities, so much money doesn’t go to packaging—you essentially can buy the 12 ozs. for not much more than 20 cents. So you are paying not much more than twice the per oz. price of 1936. This is a product that has gotten cheaper and cheaper relative to people’s earning power over the years. And which people love. And in 200 countries, you have the per capita consumption use going up every year for a product that is over 100 years old that dominates the market. That is unbelievable.

这个产品在1936年时，我第一次以25美分买了6瓶，每瓶卖5美分。那是6.5盎司的瓶子，你还要付2美分的瓶子押金。当时一瓶6.5盎司的卖5美分；现在是12盎司的罐装，如果你在周末买，或者买大包装，包装成本没那么多，你基本上花不到20美分就能买到12盎司。所以，按每盎司的价格算，你现在付的钱只比1936年多不到一倍。多年来，相对于人们的收入能力，这个产品越来越便宜了。而且人们爱它。在200个国家，每年人均消费量都在增加，这是一个超过100年历史、主导市场的产品。这太不可思议了。

One thing that people don’t understand is one thing that makes this product worth 10s and 10s of billions of dollars is one simple fact about really all colas, but we will call it Coca-Cola for the moment. It happens to be a name that I like. Cola has no taste memory. You can drink one of these at 9 O’clock, 10 O’clock, 1 O’clock and 5 O’clock. The one at 5 o’clock will taste as good to you as the one you drank early in the morning, you can’t do that with Cream Soda, Root Beer, Orange, Grape. All of those things accumulate on you. Most foods and beverages accumulate; you get sick of them after a while. And if you eat See’s Candy—we get these people who go to work for us at See’s Candy and the first day they go crazy, but after a week they are eating the same amount as if they were buying it, because chocolate accumulates on you. There is no taste memory to Cola and that means you get people around the world who will be heavy users—who will drink five a day, or for Diet Coke, 7 or even 8 a day. They will never do that with other products. So you get this incredible per capita consumption. The average person in this part of the world or maybe a little north of here drinks 64 ozs. of liquid a day. You can have 64 ozs. of that be Coke and you will not get fed up with Coke if you like it to start with in the least. But if you do that with anything else; if you eat just one product all day, you will get a little sick of it after a while.

有一件事人们不理解，但正是这件事让这个产品价值数百亿美元，只因为一个关于可乐的简单事实——我们现在就说可口可乐，因为我喜欢这个名字。可乐没有味觉记忆。你可以在早上9点、10点、下午1点、5点喝可乐，5点喝的那瓶味道和你早上喝的那瓶一样好。你不能对奶油苏打、根汁汽水、橙汁或葡萄汁这样做。那些东西喝多了会让你腻。多数食物和饮料都会让你腻，过一阵子你就受不了了。如果你吃喜诗糖果——我们有些人在喜诗糖果工作，第一天他们会吃得很疯狂，但一周后，他们吃的量就跟买糖果时一样了，因为巧克力会让你腻。可乐没有味觉记忆，这意味着全世界会有很多人成为重度用户——一天喝五瓶，或者如果是健怡可乐，可能喝七瓶甚至八瓶。他们不会对其他产品这样做。所以你会看到惊人的人均消费量。在这个地区，或者可能稍微往北一点，平均每人每天喝64盎司的液体。你可以让这64盎司全是可乐，如果你一开始就喜欢可乐，你完全不会腻。但如果你对其他任何产品这样做，整天只吃一种东西，过不了多久你就会觉得腻。

It is a huge factor. So today over 1 billion of Coca-Cola product servings will be sold in the world and that will grow year by year. It will grow in every country virtually, and it will grow on a per capita basis. And twenty years from now it will grow a lot faster internationally than in the U.S., so I really like that market better, because there is more growth there over time. But it will hurt them in the short term right now, but that doesn’t mean anything. Coca-Cola went public in 1919; the stock sold for \$40 per share. The Chandler family bought the whole business for \$2,000 back in the late 1880s. So now he goes public in 1919, \$40 per share. One year later it is selling for \$19 per share. It has gone down 50% in one year. You might think it is some kind of disaster and you might think sugar prices increased and the bottlers were rebellious. And a whole bunch of things. You can always find reasons that weren't the ideal moment to buy it. Years later you would have seen the Great Depression, WW II and sugar rationing and thermonuclear weapons and the whole thing—there is always a reason.

这是一个巨大的因素。今天，全球每天会卖出超过10亿份可口可乐产品，这个数字会逐年增长。几乎每个国家都会增长，人均消费量也会增加。二十年后，国际市场的增长会远超美国，所以我更看好那个市场，因为长期来看增长空间更大。但现在短期内，亚洲危机可能会对他们造成影响，但这没什么大不了。可口可乐在1919年上市，股票每股40美元。钱德勒家族在19世纪80年代末以2000美元买下了整个公司。上市一年后，股价跌到每股19美元，一年内跌了50%。你可能会觉得这是场灾难，可能会觉得糖价上涨，瓶装厂反抗，还有一堆其他问题。你总能找到理由，觉得那不是买的最佳时机。多年后，你会看到大萧条、二战、糖配给、热核武器等等——总有理由。

But in the end if you had bought one share at \$40 per share and reinvested the dividends, it would be worth \$5 million now (\$40 compounding at 14.63% for 86 years!). That factor so overrides anything else. If you are right about the business you will make a lot of money. The timing part of it is very tricky thing so I don’t worry about any given event if I got a wonderful business what it does next year or something of the sort. Price controls have been in this country at various times and that has fouled up even the best of businesses. I wouldn’t be able to raise prices Dec 31st on See’s Candy. But that doesn’t make it a lousy business if that happens to happen, because you are not going to have price controls forever. We had price controls in the early 70s.

但最终，如果你以每股40美元买了一股，并把股息再投资，现在它价值500万美元（40美元以14.63%的年复利增长86年！）。这个因素压倒了一切。如果你选对了生意，你就会赚很多钱。时机的部分非常难把握，所以我不会担心某个特定事件，比如一家好生意明年会怎样。价格管制在这个国家时有发生，这会干扰即使是最好的生意。我可能无法在12月31日给喜诗糖果提价。但如果发生了这种情况，也不会让它变成一门烂生意，因为价格管制不会永远持续。我们在70年代初就经历过价格管制。

The wonderful business—you can figure what will happen, you can’t figure out when it will happen. You don’t want to focus too much on when but you want to focus on what. If you are right about what, you don’t have to worry about when very much. 

好生意——你可以预见会发生什么，但你无法确定什么时候发生。你不应该太关注“什么时候”，而应该关注“是什么”。如果你对“是什么”判断正确，你就不需要太担心“什么时候”。

**Question 7**: What about your business mistakes?

**问题 7**：您犯过的商业错误有哪些？

**Buffett**: How much time do you have? The interesting thing about investments for me and my partner, Charlie Munger, the biggest mistakes have not been mistakes of commission, but of omission. They are where we knew enough about the business to do something and where, for one reason or another, sat they're sucking out thumbs instead of doing something. And so we have passed up things where we could have made billions and billions of dollars from things we understood, forget about things we don’t understand. The fact I could have made billions of dollars from Microsoft doesn’t mean anything because I never could understand Microsoft. But if I can make billions out of healthcare stocks, then I should make it. And I didn’t when the Clinton health care program was proposed and they all went in the tank. We should have made a ton of money out of that because I could understand it. And didn’t make it.

**巴菲特**：你有多少时间？对我和我的搭档查理·芒格来说，有趣的是，最大的错误不是我们做了什么，而是我们没做什么。那些是我们对生意足够了解，本该采取行动，但出于某种原因，我们只是干坐着、咬着大拇指没行动。所以我们错过了一些我们理解的、能赚几十亿美元的机会，至于那些我们不理解的就不算了。我本可以从微软赚几十亿，但那没意义，因为我从没理解微软。但如果我能从医疗股赚几十亿，我就应该赚。当克林顿的医疗改革计划提出时，医疗股全线下跌，我们本该赚一大笔钱，因为我理解这个行业。但我们没赚到。

I should have made a ton of money out of Fannie Mae back the mid-1980s, but I didn’t do it. Those are billion dollar mistakes or multi-billion dollar mistakes that generally accepted accounting principles don’t pick up. The mistakes you see. I made a mistake when I bought US Air Preferred some years ago. I had a lot of money around. I make mistakes when I get cash. Charlie tells me to go to a bar instead. Don’t hang around the office. But I hang around the office and I have money in my pocket, I do something dumb. It happens every time. So I bought this thing. Nobody made me buy it. I now have an 800 number I call every time I think about buying a stock in an airline. I say, “I am Warren and I am an air-aholic.” They try to talk me down, “Keep talking don’t do anything rash.” Finally I got over it. But I bought it. And it looked like we would lose all our money in it. And we came very close to losing all our money in it.

我在1980年代中期本该从房利美（Fannie Mae）赚一大笔钱，但我没做。这些是数十亿美元甚至上百亿美元的错误，一般公认会计准则不会记录这些错误。你能看到的错误是，我几年前买了美国航空的优先股，犯了个错误。我当时手头有很多现金。只要我有现金，我就会犯错。查理告诉我应该去酒吧，别待在办公室。但我待在办公室，口袋里有钱，就会做蠢事。每次都这样。所以我买了这个东西。没人逼我买。我现在有个800号码，每次我想买航空股时就打这个电话。我说：“我是沃伦，我是个航空股瘾君子。”他们会试着劝我冷静，“继续说，别做冲动的事。”最后我克服了。但我确实买了。当时看起来我们会亏光所有的钱，真的差一点就全亏了。

You can say we deserved to lose our money it. We bought it because it was an attractive security. But it was not in an attractive industry. I did the same thing in Salomon. I bought an attractive security in a business I wouldn’t have bought the equity in. So you could say that is one form of mistake. Buying something because you like the terms, but you don’t like the business that well. I have done that in the past and will probably do that again. The bigger mistakes are the ones of omission. Back when I had \$10,000 I put \$2,000 of it into a Sinclair Service Station which I lost, so the opportunity cost on that money is about \$6 billion right now--fairly big mistakes. It makes me feel good when my Berkshire goes down, because the cost of my Sinclair Station goes down too. My 20% opportunity cost. I will say this, it is better to learn from other people’s mistakes as much as possible. But we don’t spend any time looking back at Berkshire. I have a partner, Charlie Munger; we have been pals for forty years—never had an argument. We disagree on things a lot but we don’t have arguments about it.

可以说我们活该亏钱。我们买它是因为它是个吸引人的证券，但它所在的行业并不吸引人。我在所罗门兄弟公司也干了同样的事。我买了一个吸引人的证券，但这个生意的股权我本不会买。所以可以说，这是一种错误。因为你喜欢交易条件就买了，但你并不那么喜欢这门生意。我过去这样做过，可能会再犯这种错误。但更大的错误是错过的机会。早年我有1万美元，把2000美元投进了一个辛克莱服务站，结果亏了，那笔钱的机会成本现在大概是60亿美元——相当大的错误。每当伯克希尔的股价下跌时，我感觉还不错，因为我那个辛克莱服务站的成本也降低了。我20%的机会成本。我得说，尽可能从别人的错误中学习是更好的。但在伯克希尔，我们从不花时间回顾过去。我有个搭档，查理·芒格，我们做了四十年朋友，从没吵过架。我们在很多事上意见不同，但我们不会为此争吵。

We never look back. We just figure there is so much to look forward to that there is no sense thinking of what we might have done. It just doesn’t make any difference. You can only live life forward. You can learn something perhaps from the mistakes, but the big thing to do is to stick with the businesses you understand. So if there is a generic mistake outside your circle of competence like buying something that somebody tips you on or something of the sort. In an area you know nothing about, you should learn something from that which is to stay with what you can figure out yourself. You really want your decision making to be by looking in the mirror. Saying to yourself, “I am buying 100 shares of General Motors at \$55 because……..” It is your responsibility if you are buying it. There’s gotta be a reason and if you can’t state the reason, you shouldn’t buy it. If it is because someone told you about it at a cocktail party, not good enough. It can’t be because of the volume or a reason like the chart looks good. It has to be a reason to buy the business. That we stick to pretty carefully. That is one of the things Ben Graham taught me.

我们从不回头看。我们觉得前方有太多值得期待的东西，思考过去可能做的事没什么意义。过去的事无关紧要。你只能向前生活。你或许能从错误中学到点什么，但最重要的是坚持做你理解的生意。如果犯了一个泛泛的错误，比如在你的能力圈之外买了东西，或者因为别人给了你小道消息，或者在你一无所知的领域投资，你应该从中学会一件事：坚持做你自己能弄明白的生意。你得自己做决定，站在镜子前，对自己说：“我以55美元买100股通用汽车，因为……”买股票是你的责任，你得有理由。如果你说不出理由，就不该买。如果只是因为在鸡尾酒会上有人告诉你，或者因为成交量大，或者图表看起来不错，这些都不够好。买的理由必须是因为这门生意本身。我们对此非常谨慎。这是本·格雷厄姆教我的东西之一。

**Question 8**: The current tenuous economic situation and interest rates? Where are we going? 

**问题 8**：基于当前不稳定的经济形势和利率？我们将走向何方？

**Buffett**: I don’t think about the macro stuff. What you really want to in investments is figure out what is important and knowable. If it is unimportant and unknowable, you forget about it. What you talk about is important but, in my view, it is not knowable. Understanding Coca-Cola is knowable or Wrigley’s or Eastman Kodak. You can understand those businesses that are knowable. Whether it turns out to be important depends where your valuation leads you and the firm’s price and all that. But we have never not bought or bought a business because of any Macro feeling of any kind because it doesn’t make any difference. Let’s say in 1972 when we bought See’s Candy, I think Nixon put on the price controls a little bit later, but so what! We would have missed a chance to buy something for \$25 million that is producing \$60 million pre-tax now. We don’t want to pass up the chance to do something intelligent because of some prediction about something we are no good on anyway. So we don’t read or listen to in relation to macro factors at all. The typical investment counselor organization goes out and they bring out their economist and they trot him out and he gives you this big macro picture. And they start working from there on down. In our view that is nonsense.

**巴菲特**：我不考虑宏观的东西。在投资中，你真正想做的是弄清楚什么是重要的、可知的。如果它不重要或不可知，你就忘掉它。你说的这些东西很重要，但在我看来，它们是不可知的。理解可口可乐、箭牌或柯达是可知的。你能理解这些生意。至于它是否重要，取决于你的估值、公司的价格等等。但我们从不因为任何宏观感觉而决定买或不买一家公司，因为这没区别。比如说，1972年我们买喜诗糖果时，我想尼克松后来实施了价格管制，但那又怎样！我们就不会因为这个错过以2500万美元买下现在税前赚6000万美元的机会。我们不想因为对我们本来就不擅长的东西的预测，而错过做明智投资的机会。所以我们完全不读也不听关于宏观因素的东西。典型的投资顾问机构会请出他们的经济学家，让他给你讲一大堆宏观图景，然后从那开始往下分析。在我们看来，这很荒谬。

If Alan Greenspan was on the one side of me and Robert Rubin on the other side and they both were whispering in my ear exactly what they were going to do the next twelve months, it wouldn’t make any difference to me what I would pay for Executive Jet or General Re or anything else I do.

如果艾伦·格林斯潘在我一边，罗伯特·鲁宾在另一边，他们俩都在我耳边低语，告诉我未来十二个月他们要做什么，这对我决定为Executive Jet、通用再保险或其他任何生意支付多少钱都不会有任何影响。

**Question 9**: What is the benefit of being an out-of-towner as opposed to being on Wall Street?

**问题 9**：作为一个不在华尔街的外地人，相比在华尔街有什么优势？

**Buffett**: I worked on Wall Street for a couple of years and I have my best friends on both coasts. I like seeing them. I get ideas when I go there. But the best way to think about investments is to be in a room with no one else and just think. And if that doesn’t work, nothing else is going to work. The disadvantage of being in any type of market environment like Wall Street in the extreme is that you get over-stimulated. You think you have to do something every day. The Chandler family paid \$2,000 for this company (Coke). You don’t have to do much else if you pick one of those. And the trick then is not to do anything else. Even not to sell at 1919, which the family did later on. So what you are looking for is some way to get one good idea a year. And then ride it to its full potential and that is very hard to do in an environment where people are shouting prices back and forth every five minutes and shoving reports in front of your nose and all that. Wall Street makes its money on activity. You make your money on inactivity. If everyone in this room trades their portfolio around every day with every other person, you will all end up broke. And the intermediary will end up with all the money. If you all own stock in a group of average businesses and just sit here for the next 50 years, you will end up with a fair amount of money and your broker will be broke. He is like the Doctor who gets paid on how often to get you to change pills. If he gave you one pill that cures you the rest of your life, he would make one sale, one transaction and that is it. But if he can convince you that changing pills every day is the way to great health, it will be great for him and the prescriptionists. You won’t be any healthier and you will be a lot worse off financially. You want to stay away from any environment that stimulates activity. And Wall Street would have the effective of doing that.

**巴菲特**：我在华尔街工作过几年，我在东西两岸都有很好的朋友。我喜欢去那儿见他们，也能从中得到一些想法。但思考投资最好的方式是独自一人待在一个房间里，静静地思考。如果这都行不通，其他任何方法也不会有用。在像华尔街这样的市场环境中，最大的劣势是你会受到过度刺激。你会觉得自己每天都得做点什么。钱德勒家族花2000美元买了可口可乐这家公司。如果你选对了这样的公司，之后不需要做太多事。关键是不要做其他事。甚至在1919年也不卖，钱德勒家族后来卖了。所以，你要做的就是一年找到一个好主意，然后充分发挥它的潜力。在一个每五分钟就有人喊价格、把报告塞到你面前的环境中，这很难做到。华尔街靠交易赚钱，你靠不交易赚钱。如果在座的每个人每天都和别人频繁交易投资组合，你们都会破产，而中间人会赚走所有钱。如果你们都持有一组普通生意的股票，然后静静地持有50年，你们会赚到不少钱，而你的经纪人会破产。他就像一个医生，靠让你频繁换药赚钱。如果他给你一颗药能治好你一辈子，他只赚一次交易的钱，仅此而已。但如果他能说服你每天换药对健康最好，那对他和药剂师来说就太好了。你不会更健康，财务上却会糟糕得多。你要远离任何刺激交易的环境，而华尔街就是这样的地方。

When I went back to Omaha, I would go back with a whole list of companies I wanted to check out and I would get my money’s worth out of those trips, but then I would go back to Omaha and think about it.

当我回到奥马哈，我会带回一长串想研究的公司名单，那些出差让我物有所值，但回到奥马哈后，我会静静地思考。

**Question 10**: How to evaluate Berkshire or MSFT if it does not pay dividends? 

**问题 10**：如果伯克希尔或微软不支付股息，如何评估它们？

**Buffett**: It won’t pay any dividends either. That is a promise I can keep. All you get with Berkshire, you stick it in your safe deposit box and then every year you go down and fondle it. You take it out and then you put it back. There is enormous psychic reward in that. Don’t underestimate it. The real question is if we can retain dollar bills and turn them into more than a dollar at a decent rate. That is what we try to do. And Charlie Munger and I have all our money in it to do that. That is all we will get paid for doing. We won’t take any options or we won’t take any salaries to speak of. But that is what we are trying to do. It gets harder all the time. The more money we manage the harder it is to do that. We would do way better percentage wise with Berkshire if it was 1/100th the present size. It is run for its owners, but it isn’t run to give them dividends because so far every dollar that we earned or could have paid out, we have turned into more than a dollar. It is worth more than a dollar to keep it. Therefore, it would be silly to pay it out. Even if everyone was tax-free that owned it. It would have been a mistake to pay dividends at Berkshire. Because so far the dollar bills retained have turned into more than a dollar. But there is no guarantee that happens in the future. At some point the game runs out on that. That is what the business is about. Nothing else about the business do we judge ourselves by. We don’t judge it by the size of its home office building or anything the like the number of people working there. We have 12 people working at headquarters and 45,000 employees at Berkshire, 12 people at HQ and 3,500 sq ft. and we won’t change it. But we will judge ourselves by the performance of the company and that is the only way we will get paid. But believe me, it is a lot harder than it used to be.

**巴菲特**：伯克希尔也不会支付股息。这是我能保证的。持有伯克希尔，你只能把股票放进保险箱，每年拿出来摸一摸，感受一下，然后放回去。这其中有巨大的心理回报，别低估它。真正的问题是我们能否留住每一美元，并以不错的回报率把它变成超过一美元。这是我们努力的目标。我和查理·芒格把我们所有的钱都投进去，就是为了这个。我们不会拿期权，也不会拿多少薪水。这就是我们努力的事。事情越来越难。我们管理的钱越多，做到这一点就越难。如果伯克希尔的规模只有现在的百分之一，我们的回报率会高得多。伯克希尔是为它的股东经营的，但我们不派股息，因为到目前为止，我们赚的每一美元，或者本可以派发的每一美元，都变成了超过一美元的回报。留着这些钱比派发出去更有价值。所以，派发股息是愚蠢的，即使股东都不用纳税，派股息也是错误的。因为到目前为止，留下的每一美元都变成了超过一美元。但未来没有保证这种情况会持续。生意就是这么回事。我们只用公司的业绩来评判自己，不看总部大楼的规模或员工人数。我们总部只有12个人，占地3500平方英尺，不会改变。但我们会用公司的表现来评判自己，这是我们获得回报的唯一方式。相信我，这比以前难多了。

**Question 11**: What tells you when an investment has reached its full potential? 

**问题 11**：什么告诉你一项投资已经达到了它的全部潜力？

**Buffett**: I don’t buy Coke with the idea it will be out of gas in 10 years or 50 years. There could be something that happens by I think the chances are almost nil. So what we really want to do is buy businesses that we would be happy to own forever. It is the same way I fell about people who buy Berkshire. I want people who buy Berkshire to plan to hold it forever. They may not for one reason or the other but I want them at the time they buy it to think they are buying a business they are going to want to own forever. And I don’t say that is the only way to buy things. It is just the group to join me because I don’t want to have a changing group all the time. I measure Berkshire by how little activity there is in it. If I had a church and I was the preacher and half the congregation left every Sunday. I wouldn’t say, “It is marvelous to have all this liquidity among my members.” Terrific turnover… I would rather go to church where all the seats are filled every Sunday by the same people. Well that is the way we look at the businesses we buy. We want to buy something virtually forever. And we can’t find a lot of those. And back when I started, I had way more ideas than money so I was just constantly having to sell what was the least attractive stock in order to buy something I just discovered that looked even cheaper. But that is not our problem really now. So we hope we are buying businesses that we are just as happy holding five years from now as now. And if we ever found a huge acquisition, then maybe we would have to sell something. Maybe to make that acquisition but that would be a very pleasant problem to have. We never buy something with a price target in mind. We never buy something at 30 saying if it goes to 40 we’ll sell it or 50 or 60 or 100. We just don’t do it that way. Anymore than when we buy a private business like See’s Candy for \$25 million. We don’t ever say if we ever get an offer of \$50 million for this business we will sell it. That is not the way to look at a business. The way to look at a business is this going to keep producing more and more money over time? And if the answer to that is yes, you don’t need to ask any more questions.

**巴菲特**：我买可口可乐时，没想着它10年或50年后会没潜力了。可能会发生些什么，但我认为这种可能性几乎为零。所以我们真正想做的是买那些我们愿意永远持有的生意。就像我希望买伯克希尔的人一样，我想让他们买的时候就打算永远持有。他们可能因为各种原因没做到，但我希望他们在买的时候想着买的是一个他们想永远拥有的生意。我不是说这是唯一的投资方式，但这是和我一起的人应该有的方式，因为我不希望股东老是换来换去。我用伯克希尔的交易活跃度来衡量它。如果我是个牧师，教堂的会众每星期天走一半，我不会说：“我的成员流动性这么高，太棒了。”高换手率……我宁愿去一个每星期天座位都坐满、都是同样一群人的教堂。这就是我们看待我们买的生意的方式。我们想买几乎可以永远持有的东西。这样的生意不多。早年我开始时，点子比钱多，所以我总是得卖掉吸引力最小的股票，去买刚发现的更便宜的股票。但现在这不是问题。我们希望买的生意是五年后我们依然乐意持有的。如果我们找到一个大收购，也许得卖点什么来完成收购，但那会是个愉快的难题。我们从不带着价格目标买东西。我们不会买一个30美元的东西，说如果涨到40、50、60或100美元就卖。我们不这样干。就像我们以2500万美元买喜诗糖果，我们从不会说如果有人出5000万我们就卖。这不是看生意的方式。看生意的方式是：这门生意会随着时间推移赚越来越多的钱吗？如果答案是肯定的，你就不需要再问其他问题了。

**Questions 12**: How did you decide to invest in Salomon?

**问题 12**：你是如何决定投资所罗门兄弟的？

**Buffett**: Salomon like I said, I went into that because it was a 9% security in 1987 in September 1987 and the Dow was up 35% and we sold a lot of stuff. And I had a lot of money around and it looked to me like we would never get to do anything, so I took an attractive security form in a business I would never buy the common stock of. I went in because of that and I think generally it is a mistake. It worked out OK finally on that. But it is not what I should have been doing. I either should have waited in which case I could have bought more Coca-Cola a year later or thereabouts or I should have even bought Coke at the prices it was selling at even though it was selling at a pretty good price at the time. So that was a mistake. On Long-Term Capital that is—we have owned other businesses associated with securities over the years-–One of them is arbitrage. I’ve done arbitrage for 45 years and Graham did it for 30 years before that. That is a business unfortunately I have to be near a phone for. I have to really run it (arbitrage operations) out of the office myself, because it requires being more market-attuned because I don’t want to do that anymore. So unless a really big arbitrage situation came along that I understood, I won’t be doing much of that. But I’ve probably participated in about 300 arbitrage situations at least in my life maybe more. It was a good business, a perfectly good business. LTCM has a bunch of positions, they have tons of positions, but the top ten are probably 90% of the money that is at risk, and I know something about those ten positions. I don’t know everything about them by a long shot, but I know enough that I would feel OK at a big discount going in and we had the staying power to hold it out. We might lose money on something on that, but the odds are with us. That is a game that I understand. There are few other positions we have that are not that big because they can’t get that big. But they could involve yield curve relationships or on the run/off the run governments that are just things you learn over time being around securities markets. They are not the base of our business. Probably on average, they have accounted for ½ - ¾ a percentage point of our return a year. They are little pluses you get for actually having been around a long time. Arbitrage One of the first arbitrages I did involved a company that offered cocoa beans in exchange for their stock. That was in 1955. I bought the stock, turned in the stock, got warehouse certificates for cocoa beans and they happen to be a different type but there was a basis differential and I sold them. That was something I was around at the time, so I learned about it. There hasn’t been a cocoa deal since. 40 odd years, I have been waiting for a cocoa deal. I haven’t seen it. It is there in my memory if it ever comes along. LTCM is that on a big scale.

**巴菲特**：就像我说的，所罗门，我在1987年9月投资了它，因为那是一个9%的证券。当时道琼斯指数涨了35%，我们卖了很多东西。我手头有很多现金，感觉好像永远找不到好机会，所以我买了一个在证券形式上很吸引人的东西，但这个行业的普通股我绝不会买。我是因为这个原因投资的，我认为这通常是个错误。最后结果还算可以，但这不是我该做的事。我要么应该再等等，差不多一年后我就能买更多可口可乐的股票，或者即使当时可口可乐的价格已经挺高，我也应该买。所以那是个错误。至于长期资本管理公司（LTCM），我们多年来也拥有过其他与证券相关的生意，其中之一是套利。我做了45年的套利，格雷厄姆在我之前做了30年。这门生意不幸的是我得守在电话旁。我得亲自在办公室里操作套利，因为它需要更贴近市场动向，而我不想再那样做了。所以除非出现一个我理解的大套利机会，我不会做太多这方面的东西。但我一生中大概参与了至少300次套利，也许更多。这是个好生意，完全没问题。LTCM有很多仓位，他们有无数仓位，但前十个仓位可能占了90%的风险资金，我对这十个仓位有些了解。我远不是全都知道，但我知道的够多了，如果以大幅折扣进入，我会觉得没问题，我们也有坚持到底的实力。我们可能在这上面亏钱，但胜算在我们这边。这是我懂得的游戏。我们还有其他一些仓位，规模不大，因为它们没法太大。可能是收益率曲线关系，或者在市场上活跃/不活跃的政府债券，这些是你长期在证券市场里学到的东西。它们不是我们生意的基础。平均来说，它们大概每年为我们的回报贡献了0.5%到0.75%。这些是你长期混迹市场得到的小额外回报。套利嘛，我最早的一次套利是在1955年，涉及一家公司用可可豆换他们的股票。我买了股票，交回股票，拿到了可可豆的仓库凭证，虽然品种不同，但有基差，我卖了它们。那时候我在场，所以学到了这个。之后四十多年，我一直在等另一个可可交易，但没再见过。它存在我的记忆里，如果再出现，我还能用。LTCM就是这种东西，但规模大得多。

**Question 13**: Diversification?

**问题 13**：分散投资？

**Buffett**: The question is about diversification. I have a dual answer to that. If you are not a professional investor. If your goal is not to manage money to earn a significantly better return than the world, then I believe in extreme diversification. I believe 98% - 99% who invest should extensively diversify and not trade, so that leads them to an index fund type of decision with very low costs. All they are going to do is own part of America. And they have made a decision that owning a part of America is worthwhile. I don’t quarrel with that at all. That is the way they should approach it unless they want to bring an intensity to the game to make a decision and start evaluating businesses. Once you are in the businesses of evaluating businesses and you decide that you are going to bring the effort and intensity and time involved to get that job done, then I think diversification is a terrible mistake to any degree. I got asked that question the other day at SunTrust. If you really know businesses, you probably shouldn’t own more than six of them. If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is gotta be a terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their best idea. So I would say for anyone working with normal capital who really knows the businesses they have gone into, six is plenty, and I probably have half of what I like best. I don’t diversify personally. All the people I’ve known that have done well with the exception of Walter Schloss, Walter diversifies a lot. I call him Noah, he has two of everything.

**巴菲特**：关于分散投资的问题，我的答案有两方面。如果你不是专业投资者，如果你不是以管理资金来获得远超市场的回报为目标，那么我相信应该极度分散投资。我认为98%到99%的投资者应该广泛分散投资，而且不要频繁交易，这会让他们选择指数基金这样低成本的方式。他们所做的就是拥有一部分美国的企业，而且他们认定拥有美国的一部分是值得的。我完全不反对这种方式。这是他们应该采取的方法，除非他们想投入大量精力去评估生意。一旦你开始评估生意，决定投入努力、专注和时间来做好这件事，那么我认为任何程度的分散投资都是个糟糕的错误。前几天在SunTrust也有人问我这个问题。如果你真的了解生意，你可能不应该持有超过六家。如果能找出六家很棒的生意，那就足够分散了，你会赚很多钱。我可以保证，买第七家而不是把更多钱投到你最好的那一家，绝对是个大错。很少有人靠第七个最好的点子发财，但很多人靠最好的点子发了财。所以，对那些用普通资金、真正了解自己投资生意的普通人来说，六家就足够了，我自己可能只持有一半我最喜欢的生意。我个人不分散投资。我认识的所有成功人士，除了沃尔特·施洛斯，他分散得很厉害。我叫他诺亚，他什么都有两份。

**Question 14**: How do you distinguish the Cokes of the world from the Proctor & Gambles of this world?

**问题 14**：你如何区分世界上的可口可乐和宝洁这样的公司？

**Buffett**: Well, P&G is a very, very good business with strong distribution capability and lots of brand names, but if you ask me and I am going to go away for twenty years and put all my family’s net worth into one business, would I rather have P&G or Coke? Actually P&G is more diversified among product line, but I would feel more sure of Coke than P&G. I wouldn’t be unhappy if someone told me I had to own P&G during the twenty-year period. I mean that would be in my top 5 percent. Because they are not going to get killed, but I would feel better about the unit growth and pricing power of a Coke over twenty or thirty years. Right now the pricing power might be tough, but you think a billion servings a day for a penny each or \$10 million per day. We own 8% of that, so that is \$800,000 per day for Berkshire Hathaway. You could get another penny out of the stuff. It doesn’t seem impossible. I think it is worth a penny more. Right now it would be a mistake to try and get it in most markets. But over time, Coke will make more per serving than it does now. Twenty years from now I guarantee they will make more per serving, and they will be selling a whole lot more servings. I don't know how many or how much more, but I know that. P&G's main products--I don't think they have the kind of dominance, and they don't have the kind of unit growth, but they are good businesses. I would not be unhappy if you told me that I had to put my family's net worth into P&G and that was the only stock I would own. I might prefer some other name, but there are not 100 other names I would prefer.

**巴菲特**：宝洁是一家非常非常好的公司，拥有强大的分销能力和众多品牌名称。但如果让我离开二十年，把我家族的全部净资产投入一家公司，我会在宝洁和可口可乐之间选哪家？其实宝洁的产品线更分散，但我对可口可乐更有把握。如果有人告诉我必须在二十年内持有宝洁，我也不会不高兴。它会排在我的前5%。因为它不会垮掉。但我对可口可乐在二十或三十年内的单位增长和定价能力更有信心。现在提价可能有点难，但想想每天10亿份，每份涨一分钱，就是每天1000万美元。我们持有8%的股份，那就是伯克希尔每天80万美元的收入。再涨一分钱似乎不是不可能的。我觉得它值多一分钱。现在在大多数市场提价可能是错误的。但随着时间推移，可口可乐每份的收入会比现在高。二十年后，我保证他们每份赚得更多，而且销量会大幅增长。我不知道具体多少，但我知道会这样。宝洁的主要产品，我认为它们没有那种主导地位，也没有那样的单位增长，但它们是好生意。如果告诉我必须把家族的净资产全投到宝洁，而且只能持有一只股票，我不会不高兴。我可能更喜欢其他一些公司，但能让我更喜欢的也不会超过100家。

**Question 15**: Would you buy McDonald’s and go away for twenty years? 

**问题 15**：你会买麦当劳的股票然后放二十年吗？

**Buffett**: McDonald’s has a lot of things going for it, particularly abroad again. The position abroad in many countries is stronger than it is here. It is a tougher business over time. People don't want to be eating--exception to the kids when they are giving away beanie babies or something--at McDonald’s every day. If people drink five Cokes a day, they probably will drink five of them tomorrow. The fast food business is tougher than that but if you had to pick one hand to have in the fast food business, which is going to be a huge business worldwide, you would pick McDonald’s. I mean it has the strongest position. It doesn't win taste test with adults. It does very well with children and it does fine with adults, but it is not like it is a clear winner. And it is gotten into the game in recent years of being more price promotional--you remember the experiment a year ago or so. It has gotten more dependent on that rather than selling the product by itself. I like the product by itself. I feel better about Gillette if people buy the Mach 3 because they like the Mach 3 than if they get a Beanie Baby with it. So I think fundamentally it is a stronger product if that is the case. And that is probably the case. We own a lot of Gillette and you can sleep pretty well at night if you think of a couple billion men with their hair growing on their faces. It is growing all night while you sleep. Women have two legs, it is even better. So it beats counting sheep. And those are the kinds of business…(you look for). But what type of promotion am I going to put out there against Burger King next month or what if they sign up Disney and I don't get Disney? I like the products that stand alone absent price promotion or appeals although you can build a very good business based on that. And McDonald’s is a terrific business. It is not as good a business as Coke. There really hardly are any. It is a very good business and if you bet on one company in that field bet on (garbled) McDonald’s. We bought Dairy Queen a while back that is why I am plugging it shamelessly here.

**巴菲特**：麦当劳有很多优势，尤其是在海外。它的海外地位在很多国家比美国更强。但长期来看，这是个更艰难的生意。人们——除了小孩因为送小豆玩偶之类的东西——不会想每天都吃麦当劳。如果有人一天喝五瓶可乐，他们明天可能还是会喝五瓶。快餐生意比这更难，但如果你要在快餐行业选一个最好的，麦当劳是首选。它有最强的地位。成人味觉测试它不是最优的，但在儿童中很受欢迎，成人也还行，但它不是绝对的赢家。近年它更依赖价格促销——你可能记得一年前的实验。它越来越依赖促销，而不是产品本身。我更喜欢产品本身。如果人们因为喜欢Mach 3剃须刀而买吉列，而不是因为送小豆玩偶，我会感觉更好。所以如果产品本身够强，我认为那是更强的生意。可能是这样。我们持有大量吉列股票，想到全球20亿男人的脸上毛发在生长，你晚上能睡得很好。毛发整晚都在长。女人有两条腿，那就更好了。这比数绵羊好多了。这就是你要找的生意……但如果下个月我得针对汉堡王搞促销，或者他们签了迪士尼而我没签到怎么办？我喜欢那些不需要价格促销或噱头就能独立存在的产品，尽管你也可以靠促销建立很好的生意。麦当劳是一门很棒的生意，但它不如可口可乐好。几乎没什么生意比得上可口可乐。它是很好，但如果你要在这个行业选一家公司，选麦当劳。我们前段时间买了Dairy Queen，所以我在这儿毫不掩饰地推销它。

**Question 16**: What do I think about the utility industry?

**问题 16**：我对公用事业行业的看法是什么？

**Buffett**: I have thought about that a lot because you can put big money in it. I have even thought of buying the entire businesses. There is a fellow in Omaha actually that has done a little of that through Cal Energy. But I don't quite understand the game in terms of how it is going to develop with deregulation. I can see how it destroys a lot of value through the high cost producer once they are not protected by a monopoly territory. I don't for sure see who benefits and how much. Obviously the guy with very low cost power or some guy has hydro-power at two cents a KwH has a huge advantage. But how much of that he gets to keep or how extensively he can send that outside his natural territory, I haven't been able to figure that out so I really know what the Industry will look like in ten years. But it is something I think about and if I ever develop any insights that call for action, I will act on them. Because I think I can understand the attractiveness of the product. All the aspects of certainty of users need and the fact it is a bargain and all of that. I understand. I don't understand who is going to make the money in ten years. And that keeps me away.

**巴菲特**：我对公用事业行业想了很多，因为这个行业可以投入大笔资金。我甚至考虑过买下整个企业。奥马哈有个人通过Cal Energy做过一些这方面的投资。但我不太明白在放松管制后这个行业的走向。我能看到，一旦高成本生产商失去了垄断区域的保护，他们的价值会大幅受损。但我不确定谁会受益，受益多少。显然，拥有低成本电力的人，比如以每千瓦时2美分的水电，会有巨大优势。但他能留住多少利润，或者能把电送到多远的区域外，我还没弄明白，所以我不知道十年后这个行业会是什么样子。但我会一直思考这个问题，如果我有了任何需要采取行动的洞见，我会行动。因为我认为我能理解这个产品的吸引力。用户需求的确定性、产品价格划算等等，我都明白。但我不知道十年后谁会赚钱。这让我保持观望。

**Question 17**: Why do large caps outperform small caps (1998)? 

**问题 17**：为什么大盘股在1998年表现优于小盘股？

**Buffett**: We don't care if a company is large cap, small cap, middle cap, micro cap. It doesn't make any difference. The only questions that matter to us: . . . •Do we understand the business? •Do we like the people running it? •And does it sell for a price that is attractive? From my personal standpoint running Berkshire now because we got, pro forma for Gen. Re, \$75 to \$80 billion to invest in and I only want to invest in five things, so I am really limited to very big companies. But if I were investing \$100,000, I wouldn't care whether something was large cap or small cap or anything. I would just look for businesses I understood. Now, I think, on balance, large cap companies as businesses have done extraordinarily well the last ten years--way better than people anticipated they would do. You really have American businesses earning close to something 20% on equity. And that is something nobody dreamed of and that is being produced by very large companies in aggregate. So you have had this huge revaluation upwards because of lower interest rates and much higher returns on capital. If America business is really a disguised bond that earns 20%, a 20% coupon it is much better than a bond with a 13% coupon. And that has happened with big companies in recent years, whether it is permanent or not is another question. I am skeptical of that. I wouldn't even think about it--except for questions of how much money we run--I wouldn't even think about the size of the business. See's Candy was a \$25 million business when we bought it. If I can find one now, as big as we are, I would love to buy it. It is the certainty of it that counts.

**巴菲特**：我们不在乎一家公司是大盘股、小盘股、中盘股还是微盘股。这没关系。我们只关心几个问题：
- 我们了解这门生意吗？
- 我们喜欢管理它的人吗？
- 它的价格有吸引力吗？
就我现在管理伯克希尔的立场，合并通用再保险后，我们有750亿到800亿美元的资金要投资，我只想投在五件事上，所以我实际上只能投大公司。但如果我只有10万美元要投资，我不会在乎是大盘股还是小盘股。我只会找我了解的生意。总体来说，过去十年，大盘公司作为生意表现得非常好——远超人们的预期。美国企业的股本回报率接近20%，这是没人预料到的，而这些回报是由大公司整体实现的。所以，由于利率降低和资本回报率大幅提高，大公司估值大幅上升。如果美国企业是一个伪装的债券，收益率20%，那比13%的债券好得多。这就是近年大公司的情况，至于这是否会持续是另一个问题。我对此持怀疑态度。但除了我们管理的资金规模问题，我根本不会考虑生意的大小。我们买喜诗糖果时，它只有2500万美元的规模。如果现在能找到这样的公司，哪怕我们规模这么大，我也愿意买。关键是确定性。

**Question 18**: The securitization of real estate?

**问题 18**：房地产证券化？

**Buffett**: There has been enormous securitization of the debt too of real estate and that is one of the items right now that is really clogging up the capital markets. The mortgage back securities are just not moving, commercial, not residential mortgage backs. But I think you are directing your question at equities probably. The equities, if you leave out the corporate form, have been a lousy way to own equities. You have interjected a corporate income tax into something that people individually have been able to own with a single tax, and to have the normal corporate form you have a double taxation in there. You really don't need it and it takes too much of the return. REITS have, in effect, created a conduit so you don't get the double taxation, but they also generally have fairly high operating expenses. If you get real estate, let's just say you can buy fairly simple types of real estate at an 8% yield, or thereabouts, and you take away close to 1% to 1.5% by the time you count stock options and everything, it is not a terribly attractive way to own real estate. Maybe the only way a guy with a \$1,000 or \$5,000 can own it but if you have \$1 million or \$10 million, you are better off owning the real estate properties yourself instead of sticking some intermediary in between who will get a sizable piece of the return for himself. So we have found very little in that field. You will see an announcement in the next couple of weeks that may belie what I am telling you today. I don't want you to think I am double crossing you up here. But generally speaking we have seen very little in that field that gets us excited. People sometimes get very confused about--they will look at some huge land company, like Texas Pacific Land Trust, which has been around over 100 years and has got a couple of million acres in Texas. And they will sell 1% of their land every year and they will take that (as income? Garbled) and come up with some huge value compared to the market value. But that is nonsense if you really own the property. You can't move. You can't move 50% of the properties or 20% of the properties, it is way worse than an illiquid stock. So you get these, I think, you get some very silly valuations placed on a lot of real estate companies by people who really don't understand what it is like to own one and try to move large quantity of properties. REITS have behaved horribly in this market as you know and it is not at all inconceivable that they become a class that would get so unpopular that they would sell at significant discounts from what you could sell the properties for. And they could get interesting as a class and then the question is whether management would fight you in that process because they would be giving up their income stream for managing things and their interests might run counter to the shareholders on that. I have always wondered about REITS that have managements they say their assets are so wonderful, and they are so cheap and then they (management) go out and sell stock. There is a contradiction in that. They say our stock is very cheap at \$28 and then they sell a lot of stock at \$28 less an underwriting commission. There is a disconnect there. But it is a field we look at. Charlie and I can understand real estate, and we would be open for very big transactions periodically. If there was a LTCM situation translated to real estate, we would be open to that, the trouble is so many other people would be too that it would unlikely go at a price that would get us really get us excited.


**巴菲特**：房地产的债务证券化非常多，这正是目前阻塞资本市场的原因之一。抵押贷款支持证券（尤其是商业地产的，不是住宅的）根本卖不动。但我想你的问题可能是关于股权的。如果不考虑公司形式，房地产股权一直是持有房地产的糟糕方式。你把公司所得税加到个人原本只需要纳税一次的投资上，普通公司形式会导致双重纳税。这完全没必要，而且拿走了太多回报。房地产投资信托（REITs）实际上创造了一个管道，避免了双重纳税，但它们的运营费用通常很高。如果你买房地产，假设你能以8%左右的收益率买到简单类型的房地产，算上股票期权等费用后，你要扣掉1%到1.5%，这就不是持有房地产的特别吸引人的方式。也许对只有1000美元或5000美元的人来说，这是唯一的方式，但如果你有100万美元或1000万美元，直接持有房地产比通过中间人好，中间人会拿走一大块回报。所以我们在这一领域找到的机会很少。接下来几周你可能会看到一个公告，可能会让我今天说的话显得矛盾。我不想让你觉得我在误导你。但总的来说，这个领域很少让我们兴奋。人们有时会很困惑——他们会看一些大型土地公司，比如有100多年历史的德州太平洋土地信托，拥有几百万英亩土地。他们每年卖1%的土地，然后（作为收入？讲话模糊）算出一个远超市值的巨大价值。但如果你真的拥有这些物业，这种算法很荒谬。你没法卖50%或20%的物业，这比不流动的股票还糟糕。所以，很多房地产公司的估值被不懂行的人高估了，他们不知道持有大量物业并试图卖掉是什么感觉。REITs在这个市场表现得很糟糕，你也知道，不难想象它们会变得极不受欢迎，以远低于物业出售价值的折扣价交易。作为一个类别，它们可能变得有趣，但问题在于管理层可能会反对你，因为他们不想放弃管理资产的收入流，他们的利益可能与股东相悖。我一直对那些REITs的管理层感到疑惑，他们说自己的资产很棒，股价很便宜，然后却以28美元的价格（减去承销佣金）卖出大量股票。这里面有矛盾。他们说我们的股票在28美元很便宜，然后他们就以28美元卖出一堆股票。这逻辑不通。但这是我们会关注的领域。我和查理能理解房地产，偶尔我们会对大交易持开放态度。如果出现一个类似LTCM的房地产情况，我们会考虑，但问题是有太多其他人也会感兴趣，价格不太可能让我们特别兴奋。

**Question 19**: A down market is good for you?

**问题 19**：市场下跌对你有好处吗？

**Buffett**: I have no idea were the market is going to go. I prefer it going down. But my preferences have nothing to do with it. The market knows nothing about my feelings. That is one of the first things you have to learn about a stock. You buy 100 shares of General Motors (GM). Now all of a sudden you have this feeling about GM. It goes down, you may be mad at it. You may say, "Well, if it just goes up for what I paid for it, my life will be wonderful again." Or if it goes up, you may say how smart you were and how you and GM have this love affair. You have got all these feelings. The stock doesn't know you own it . The stock just sits there; it doesn't care what you paid or the fact that you own it. Any feeling I have about the market is not reciprocated. I mean it is the ultimate cold shoulder we are talking about here. Practically anybody in this room is probably more likely to be a net buyer of stocks over the next ten years than they are a net seller, so everyone of you should prefer lower prices. If you are a net eater of hamburger over the next ten years, you want hamburger to go down unless you are a cattle producer. If you are going to be a buyer of Coca-Cola and you don't own Coke stock, you hope the price of Coke goes down. You are looking for it to be on sale this weekend at your Supermarket. You want it to be down on the weekends not up on the weekends when you tend the Supermarket. The NYSE is one big supermarket of companies. And you are going to be buying stocks, what you want to have happen? You want to have those stocks go down, way down; you will make better buys then. Later on twenty or thirty years from now when you are in a period when you are dis-saving, or when your heirs dis-save for you, then you may care about higher prices. There is Chapter 8 in Graham's Intelligent Investor about the attitude toward stock market fluctuations, that and Chapter 20 on the Margin of Safety are the two most important essays ever written on investing as far as I am concerned. Because when I read Chapter 8 when I was 19, I figured out what I just said but it is obvious, but I didn't figure it out myself. It was explained to me. I probably would have gone another 100 years and still thought it was good when my stocks were going up. We want things to go down, but I have no idea what the stock market is going to do. I never do and I never will. It is not something I think about at all. When it goes down, I look harder at what I might buy that day because I know there is more likely to be some merchandise there to use my money effectively in.

**巴菲特**：我不知道市场会怎么走。我更希望它下跌。但我的喜好对市场毫无影响。市场完全不知道我的感受。这是你需要了解的第一件事。你买了100股通用汽车（GM）的股票，突然你对GM有了某种感觉。如果它跌了，你可能会生气。你可能会说：“只要它涨回到我买的价格，我的生活又会美好起来。”或者如果它涨了，你可能会觉得自己多聪明，觉得自己和GM有种恋爱关系。你有各种情绪，但股票不知道你拥有它。股票只是静静地待在那里，它不在乎你买它的价格，也不在乎你拥有它。我对市场的任何感觉都不会得到回应。这就是我们说的最冷漠的对待。在座的几乎每个人，在未来十年更可能是股票的净买入者，而不是净卖出者，所以你们都应该希望价格更低。如果你未来十年是汉堡的净消费者，你会希望汉堡价格下跌，除非你是养牛的。如果你会买可口可乐但不持有它的股票，你会希望可乐价格下跌。你希望周末在超市看到它打折。你希望它在周末降价，而不是涨价，因为你会在周末去超市。纽约证券交易所就是一家大公司超市。你要买股票，你希望发生什么？你希望股票价格下跌，大幅下跌，那样你能买到更好的东西。二十或三十年后，当你开始花积蓄，或者你的继承人为你花积蓄时，你可能会在乎更高的价格。《聪明的投资者》第八章讲了对市场波动的态度，第二十章讲了安全边际，这两篇是我认为有史以来关于投资最重要的文章。因为我在19岁读到第八章时，我明白了我说的事情，虽然这很明显，但我自己没想通。有人给我解释了。如果没有这本书，我可能再过100年还是会觉得股票涨了就是好事。我们希望东西下跌，但我完全不知道股票市场会怎么走。我从来不知道，将来也不会知道。这不是我考虑的事。当市场下跌时，我会更努力地看那天能买什么，因为我知道那时候更有可能找到能有效利用我资金的东西。

**Question 20**: What would you do to live a happier life if you could live over again?

**问题 20**：如果你能重新活一次，你会做什么来过得更幸福？

**Buffett**: This will sound disgusting. The question is how would I live my life over again to live a happier life? The only thing would be to select a gene pool where people lived to 120 or something where I came from. I have been extraordinarily lucky. I mean, I use this example and I will take a minute or two because I think it is worth thinking about a little bit. Let's just assume it was 24 hours before you were born and a genie came to you and he said, "Herb, you look very promising and I have a big problem. I got to design the world in which you are going to live in. I have decided it is too tough; you design it. So you have twenty-four hours, you figure out what the social rules should be, the economic rules and the governmental rules and you and your kids and their kids will live under those rules. You say, "I can design anything? There must be a catch?" The genie says there is a catch. You don't know if you are going to be born black or white, rich or poor, male or female, infirm or able-bodied, bright or retarded. All you know is you are going to take one ball out of a barrel with 5.8 billion (balls). You are going to participate in the ovarian lottery. And that is going to be the most important thing in your life, because that is going to control whether you are born here or in Afghanistan or whether you are born with an IQ of 130 or an IQ of 70. It is going to determine a whole lot. What type of world are you going to design? I think it is a good way to look at social questions, because not knowing which ball you are going to get, you are going to want to design a system that is going to provide lots of goods and services because you want people on balance to live well. And you want it to produce more and more so your kids live better than you do and your grandchildren live better than their parents. But you also want a system that does produce lots of goods and services that does not leave behind a person who accidentally got the wrong ball and is not well wired for this particular system. I am ideally wired for the system I fell into here. I came out and got into something that enables me to allocate capital. Nothing so wonderful about that. If all of us were stranded on a desert island somewhere and we were never going to get off of it, the most valuable person there would be the one who could raise the most rice over time. I can say, "I can allocate capital!" You wouldn't be very excited about that. So I have been born in the right place. Gates says that if I had been born three million years ago, I would have been some animal's lunch. He says, "You can't run very fast, you can't climb trees, you can't do anything." You would just be chewed up the first day. You are lucky; you were born today. And I am. The question getting back, here is this barrel with 6.5 billion balls, everybody in the world, if you could put your ball back, and they took out at random a 100 balls and you had to pick one of those, would you put your ball back in? Now those 100 balls you are going to get out, roughly 5 of them will be American, 95/5. So if you want to be in this country, you will only have 5 balls, half of them will be women and half men--I will let you decide how you will vote on that one. Half of them will below average in intelligence and half above average in intelligence. Do you want to put your ball in there? Most of you will not want to put your ball back to get 100. So what you are saying is: I am in the luckiest one percent of the world right now sitting in this room--the top one percent of the world. Well, that is the way I feel. I am lucky to be born where I was because it was 50 to 1 in the United States when I was born. I have been lucky with parents, lucky with all kinds of things and lucky to be wired in a way that in a market economy, pays off like crazy for me. It doesn't pay off as well for someone who is absolutely as good a citizen as I am (by) leading Boy Scout troops, teaching Sunday School or whatever, raising fine families, but just doesn't happen to be wired in the same way that I am. So I have been extremely lucky so I would like to be lucky again. Then the way to do it is to play out the game and do something you enjoy all your life and be associated with people you like. I only work with people I like. If I could make \$100 million dollars with a guy who causes my stomach to churn, I would say no because in way that is very much like marrying for money which is probably not a very good idea in any circumstances, but if you are already rich, it is crazy. I am not going to marry for money. I would really do almost exactly what I have done except I wouldn't have bought the US Air. Thank you.

**巴菲特**：这听起来可能有点恶心。问题是我会如何重新生活来过得更幸福？唯一想做的就是选择一个基因库，让我来自一个能活到120岁的地方。我已经非常幸运了。我用一个例子说明，这个例子值得花一两分钟思考。假设在你出生前24小时，一个精灵来找你，他说：“赫伯，你看起来很有潜力，我有个大问题。我得设计你将生活的世界，但这太难了，你来设计吧。你有24小时，决定社会规则、经济规则和政府规则，你和你的孩子、他们的孩子都将在这些规则下生活。你说：‘我可以随便设计？有什么限制吗？’精灵说有，你不知道自己会生为黑人还是白人，富人还是穷人，男人还是女人，身体健全还是残疾，天才还是智障。你只知道你要从58亿个球中抽一个。你将参与一场卵巢彩票。这将是你生命中最重要的事，因为它会决定你是生在这里还是阿富汗，是智商130还是70。这会决定很多。你会设计怎样的世界？我认为这是思考社会问题的好方法，因为不知道自己会抽到哪个球，你会想设计一个能提供大量商品和服务的系统，让人们总体上生活得好。你希望它生产越来越多，让你的孩子比你生活得更好，孙子比父母更好。但你也想要一个不抛弃意外抽到坏球的人、不抛弃不适应这个系统的人的系统。我非常适合我身处的这个系统。我出生后进入了分配资本的领域。这没什么了不起。如果我们都被困在一个永远离不开的荒岛上，最有价值的人是能种最多稻米的人。我说：“我会分配资本！”你不会觉得这有什么了不起。所以我生在了正确的地方。盖茨说我如果生在300万年前，我会成为某种动物的午餐。他说：“你跑得不快，不会爬树，什么都不会。”第一天就会被吃掉。你很幸运，你生在今天。我也是。回到问题，这里有65亿个球，全世界的人，如果你可以把你的球放回去，他们随机抽出100个球，你得选一个，你会把球放回去吗？这100个球里，大约5个是美国人，95比5。如果你想在美国，你只有5个球，一半是女人，一半是男人——这个你自己决定怎么选。一半智商低于平均，一半高于平均。你想把球放回去吗？大多数人不会想放回去抽100个球。这说明什么？你在说：我现在坐在这个房间里，属于世界上最幸运的1%。这就是我的感觉。我很幸运生在我出生的地方，因为我出生时在美国的机会是50比1。我很幸运有我的父母，很多事情都很幸运，幸运地天生适合市场经济，这让我赚得盆满钵满。但对那些和我一样是好公民、带童子军、教主日学、养育优秀家庭，但天生不适合我这种模式的人，回报就不那么高。所以我非常幸运，我想再次幸运。方法就是继续玩这个游戏，做你一生喜欢的事，和你喜欢的人交往。我只和喜欢的人共事。如果我能和一个让我反感的人赚1亿美元，我会拒绝，因为这就像为了钱结婚，在任何情况下都不是好主意，如果你已经很有钱，那就更疯了。我不会为了钱结婚。我会几乎完全重复我做过的事，除了不会买美国航空的股票。谢谢。

### 个人感想
前几天看到段永平先生推荐了巴菲特1998年在佛罗里达商学院的演讲, 网上的中文翻译可能事很多年前的了,一看就是机翻, 有的翻译很糟糕, 所以借助当前的AI工具自己又翻译了一下, 结合中英文一起看了看. 总结的一些收获如下:
- 习惯和性格是可以改变的,尤其是年轻的时候. 应该努力改掉令人厌恶的品质, 同时争取拥有自己身边倾佩的人的优秀品质
- 日本的利率很低, 可以以1%的利率借到贷款, 投资收益率超过1%应该不难(捡烟头)
- 为了避免汇率风险, 要选择以日元为基准的资产(比如日本房地产, 日本公司)
- 日本的净资产收益率很低(4-6%), 如果投资的公司不赚钱, 你也很难赚钱(他当时在日本还没找到,现在在投5大商社)
- 不要做资产回报率很低的生意, **时间是好生意的朋友, 烂生意的敌人**
- 16个智商很高的人, 投资经验相当丰富, 其中还有诺贝尔奖得主, 有的人还投入了自己的全部身家, 结果公司却破产了. 为了赚更多的钱, 为了赚自己不需要的钱, 把自己需要的钱都搭进去了. 为了得到对自己不重要的东西, 搭进去了对自己重要的东西, 典型的聪明人做傻事
- 只看过去的情况, 无法确定未来金融事件发生的概率
- 不要上杠杆, 不要借钱
- 只做自己喜欢做的工作. 如果做自己不喜欢的事情, 只是为了让简历更好看, 那太愚蠢了
- 在有了基础的条件后, 再多的钱并不会让自己更快乐
- 喜欢自己能看懂的生意(可口可乐)
- 喜欢有护城河的公司, 护城河可以有多种形式(低成本, 产品认可度, 服务, 专利, 营业地点)
- 买股票就是买公司, 是公司的一部分所有权
- 只要公司生意好, 买的价格不是高的离谱, 收益就差不了
- 确定性不高的公司不买, 但是确定性高的公司, 价格一般都不会便宜, 实现不了多高的回报率. **关注的不是如何获得超高收益, 而是始终牢记永远不亏钱**
- **要清楚自己的能力圈, 每个人都有自己的能力圈, 重要的不是能力圈有多大, 而是要待在能力圈里**
- 不要过于在意价格的短期波动, 关键是要确认这是不是一个好的生意, 择时是一件小聪明的手段
- 犯过最大的错误不是做错了什么, 而是该做的没做. 尽管对生意很了解, 本应该行动, 但是却因为犹豫什么都没做, 眼睁睁看着机会溜走
- 当克林顿提出医疗改革方案后, 所有医药股都崩盘了, 他虽然看懂了医药的生意, 但是他却没有买
- 80年代的时候应该买房利美, 却没有买
- 买美国航空, 损失了很多, 包括所罗门也是, 这两个共同点是他们便宜, 但是他们的生意并不好
- 人们总说要从错误中学习, 我觉得最好是尽量从别人的错误中学习
- **未来有那么多值得期待, 何必对过去耿耿于怀, 不纠结过去的事, 人生只能向前看**
- **当准备买一支股票的时候, 一定要有一个理由, 说不出理由来别买. 别人的推荐, 走势图, 这些理由都不行, 关键在于投资生意(本 格雷厄姆)**
- 不研究宏观经济
- 关键是弄清什么事是重要的, 可知的. 如果一件事是不重要的,或者不可知的, 就先别管 (经济形式属于重要但不可知的), 但看懂公司的生意, 这个是可知的
- 当买入一家公司的时候, 不看利率和公司盈利的预期, 这些都是不确定的
- 投资最好的方式是一个人在房间里想清楚, 在任何类似于市场的环境中, 都很容易受到影响, 做出过激的反应
- 一年找到一个好的投资机会, 然后一直持有, 等待他的潜力充分释放
- 华尔街靠折腾赚钱, 普通人靠不折腾赚钱, 要远离任何刺激你瞎折腾的环境
- 把钱留在伯克希尔可以为股东赚更多的钱, 派息甚至还要交税
- 买股票的时候不设定目标价, 而应该长期看这个公司能不能赚越来越多的钱
- **对于普通投资者应该投资的足够分散, 且不要频繁交易, 他们的投资应该和指数型基金差不多, 相当于持有美国的一部分(SP500)**
- 对于专业投资者, 要研究公司并主动做投资决策, 分散投资是大错特错. 如果你真的能看懂生意, 你拥有的生意不应该超过6个,  要把钱投到自己最看好的公司中
- 更看好可口可乐这样的销售增长潜力和定价权， 确定性更强， 市场占有率更高; 当然宝洁也是很好的公司， 生意非常好，拥有强大的分销渠道和大量知名品牌
- 麦当劳的生意其实是越来越难做的, 越来越依赖促销，而不是产品本身卖的好; 更喜欢吉列， 喜欢那些不靠促销打折也能卖的很好的产品
- 公共事业行业如果失去了垄断保护， 许多高成本生产商将陷入困境， 大量价值被摧毁， 不确定谁会成为受益者， 得到多少好处
- 现在公共事业公司很便宜， 且他们的需求是确定的，  但是不知道十年后谁会赚钱， 所以还没有投资
- 因为资金量太大投资的时候受规模限制，否则不会考虑公司的大小问题， 重要的是确定性. 关键是生意好不好，管理层是否认可， 公司的价格是否便宜
- 房地产债务证券化工具大量涌现已经成为资本市场的一大顽疾; 房地产和土地的流动性很差
- 推荐 《聪明的投资者》 第8章 面对股票市场的波动 ， 第20章 安全边际
- 我运气已经很好了，我要把自己的天分发挥出来，一辈子都做自己喜欢做的事， 和自己喜欢的人共事。 无论什么时候，都不能为了钱结婚， 要是已经有钱了，就更不能这样了。我还是会一如既往的生活
